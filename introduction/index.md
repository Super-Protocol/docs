Super Protocol has launched [Public Testnet](/testnet) and our team is hard at work making it available to more people and extending its functionality. When the community is satisfied with the state of the protocol, the testnet will become the base for Mainnet launch.

As part of Testnet Phase 2 we have launched the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.superprotocol.com/), the user-friendly UI to Super Protocol. You can learn more about it [here](/testnet/marketplace/). Only participating testers can get access, so if you are interested in taking part, please [sign up](/testnet) and join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/superprotocol) to keep up to date.

You are welcome to read our [Whitepaper](/whitepaper) if you want to know more about Super Protocol.

If you have any further questions or would like to become a partner or otherwise be involved in the development of Super Protocol, please use [a request form on our website](https://superprotocol.com/contact).
