### What is Super Protocol?

[Super Protocol](https://superprotocol.com/) is a Web3 confidential cloud and marketplace, on a mission to provide confidentail computing resources to Web3 projects ([whitepaper](/whitepaper/)). Super Protocol focus is on computing, while data storage is outsourced to integrated decentralized storages. The Marketplace allows developers to monetize their solutions and data in confidential environment without the risk of losing control.

The centerpiece technology of Super Protocol is hardware protection of data in use, also known as [confidential computing](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security/confidential-computing.html). 

This technology widely expands the scope of what is possible with development of Web3 applications (dApps). Because the so called 'enclave' (also Trusted Execution Environment, TEE) protects data in use from any unauthorized third parties, code may be executed openly without encryption. Super Protocol is natively integrated with blockchain and smart-contracts, so you may be run the whole app or just a service of a dApp, using off-chain computing to remove the limitations imposed by smart-contracts

Super Protocol is fully decentralized, uncensored, and allows only machines enabled with Intel SGX processors. Confidentiality ensures that even the owners of the host machines will not have access to data executed in the TEE, meaning that you trust the verifiable technology, not some anonymous human or organization.


### What is the Super Dev Community?

Super Protocol is a Web3 infrastructure project, and as such it is only as good as the community that will build on it. We are looking for talented and dedicated developers, individuals and teams, to form the core of this community and plant the seed from which it will grow. 

We believe that decentralized confidential computing is the future and we are building a whole cloud service to prove it. And we hope that you will believe it too.

### What's the plan?

Community building is a process. We invite you to apply to participate in Phase A. 

It will consist of a small closed group with the initial goal of building new Web3 applications rooted in the principles of decentralization and confidentiality. It's your choice what to build. We will publish all properly functional solutions to the Marketplace to be used during Testnet and beyond. 

Super Protocol team will provide:
* Technical documentation on Super Protocol, guides and simple example apps for reference;
* Mentorship on building for decentralized confidential computing;
* Computing resources to host your app.

Technical use cases:

| Use Case | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Dynamic web apps with tunnels | Complex web applications (such as [Super Chat](/testnet/chat/)) that require external public IP (via tunnels).|
| Static web content with tunnels | Static web pages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that require external public IP (via tunnels).|
| Smart-contracts and oracles | Building Web3 oracles that provide a way for smart-contracts to exchange data with external off-chain sources. |
| Smart-contracts with off-chain computing | Offload the heavy lifting to off-chain computing environments to remove limitations imposed by smart-contracts. |
| Python-based solutions | Such as AI/ML Python scripts for computations on data that do not require internet access. |
| Node.js-based solutions |  |

### Who are the candidates?

We aspire to build the Super Protocol development community with people who are enthusiastic about Web3 and decentralized confidential computing. 

You are:
* Passionate about decentralization and Web3 technologies;
* Curious about confidential computing (you don't have to be an expert);
* Experienced in developing Web3 apps and dApps;
* Enthusiastic about learning and trying new things;
* A team player, willing to share feedback, contribute and be patient about technical issues that inevitably arise during testnet;
* Willing to be the pioneer at the edge of innovations and get the bragging rights!
* Comfortable sharing your knowledge and helping new members of the community who will come after you (optional, but desirable).

### How to apply?

Please fill out this application form. We anticipate an overwhelming number of request, so please be patient. This will be a highly selective process. We expect to begin in early September with the core participants and then gradually add new members.

Any questions may be directed to our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/superprotocol) server.
