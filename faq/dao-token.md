# DAO and Token
### Which network did Super Protocol choose for its blockchain solution and why?
Super Protocol will have its Token Generation Event (TGE) and some token functionality related to vesting and DAO on the Ethereum network. The main reason is that Ethereum is the most secure Layer-1 blockchain with the richest ecosystem of projects and market participants.

Operational smart contracts will be deployed on Polygon to take advantage of the very fast and cheap transactions. Polygon is a very robust and secure sidechain of Ethereum, which provides a highly functional bridge for smart contract integration between the chains.

In the future, Super Protocol will continue to expand further to other Layer-1 and Layer-2 chains where a need for decentralized cloud computing exists.
### What the Super Protocol token will be used for?
- Payments for computational resources, products, services and data
- Provider security deposits to ensue high quality and availability
- Treasury replenishment to cover future protocol expenses
- Staking and governance
### What is the Super Protocol DAO?
Super Protocol is built to continuously adapt and evolve to meet the requirements of the Web3 space itself. This is why it has to constantly improve and provide additional functionality whenever and wherever it’s needed.

At the same time Super Protocol is an open decentralized platform that should be governed by its users in accordance with the values of Web3. That is precisely the reason as to why it will be governed by DAO.

At this point, many aspects of the DAO structure and processes are still under active development. The details will be available in the upcoming months. But obviously, to join the DAO, one would have to buy tokens and, at the very least, participate in the governance process.

### How to earn on Super Protocol?
- Become a Service Provider and receive payments from its consumers
- Stake tokens and become an active part of the growing community
- Provide liquidity on major DEXs and earn farming rewards
- Participate in bounty programs and hackathons
### How does Super Protocol staking work?
There will be two staking programs in Super Protocol. The first one will start right after the Token Generation Event (TGE) and Public Sale. It will take up to 6 months. The purpose of this program is to reward early adopters while they wait for the Mainnet launch.

The second staking program will start as soon as the Mainnet is launched. It will be an integral part of the protocol tokenomics and DAO. Participation in staking will allow you not only to obtain a share of the protocol’s profits, but also grant voting power in the governance process.

To put it straight, staking with Super Protocol is a reward mechanism for those community members who believe in the project, hold tokens and participate in DAO.
