## Introduction

Super Protocol Public Testnet provides a way for everyone to get an early glimpse at what new possibilities the protocol has to offer for Web3 space. The testnet will be constantly updated and will become the base for the eventual launch of the mainnet. So it is a great opportunity to start building before the protocol becomes a mainstream!

At this point in order to participate in Super Protocol Testnet one needs to complete a registration process and acquire test account key and access token that is required to get access to Super Protocol interfaces.

## Registration

To get access to Super Protocol Testnet please fill in the [testnet application form](https://superprotocol.typeform.com/testnet). After that wait for the invitation letter from our team with test account and access token. Please, be patient. We have received a lot of applications, and we have limited computational resources at the moment.  But rest assured that all applications will be processed and everyone will get their invitation letter.

In the meantime we invite you to check manuals for our [Web User Interface](/testnet/web-ui) and [Command-line Interface (CLI)](./cli) as well as [solutions](/testnet/solutions) that are already deployed on Super Protocol Testnet.

## How to start using Super Protocol

There are currently two ways to interact with the protocol:
- [Web User Interface](/testnet/web-ui). An easy-to-use web application for those who want to quickly try out solutions already deployed on the protocol. It allows you to use your own data, but it does not support deploying your own solutions.
- [Command-line Interface (CLI)](/testnet/cli). A powerful tool for developers who want to try deploying their own solutions and leverage the full functionality of the protocol.

## Support
