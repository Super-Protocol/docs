## What is Super Protocol Testnet?

The Testnet is an operational work-in-progress version of Super Protocol. It is continuously updated with new releases and functionality as the project is making its way towards Mainnet.  

The latest public release is Testnet Phase 3, launched on July 31, 2023. It contains the following major updates:

- **Decentralized confidential Web3 chat.** [Super Chat](/testnet/chat) is a technological demo developed by the Super Protocol team. By this example we want to show how complex dynamic web apps can be run in decentralized confidential environments (TEE).

## Known Issues and Limitations

Since this is testnet, there are some limitations on performance:
- The domains will only be live for 72 hours. This is a limit we imposed to ensure consistent performance on Testnet.
- Mobile version of Marketplace is currently view-only. We will adopt full functionality in future releases.

## How to participate?

Testnet Phase 3 is now taking applications to participate.
