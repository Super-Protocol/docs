## What is Super Protocol Testnet?

The Testnet is an operational work-in-progress version of Super Protocol. It is continuously updated with new releases and functionality as the project is making its way towards mainnet.  

The latest public release is Testnet Phase 2, launched on March 13, 2023. It contains the following major updates:

- **Decentralized confidential hosting.** The users can now host their own websites on the Super Protocol network. The tunneling network protocol is used where the Tunnel Client holds the applications and data in a confidential enclave and the Tunnel Server is responsible for public ingress (public static IPâ€™s) that routes to the Client. More tunnels means more stability and resistance to attacks.

- **Marketplace UI.** The brand new user-friendly UI that is replacing the RocketGirl UI from Testnet Phase 1. This is the user interface that we will be evolving with new functionality and it will carry on to the mainnet.

Of course these are not all the updates. There is a new architecture and many other improvements under the hood.

## Known Issues and Limitations

Since this is testnet, there are some limitations on performance:
- The hosted sites will only be live for 72 hours. This is a limit we imposed to ensure consistent performance on testnet.
- Mobile version of Marketplace is currently view-only. We will adopt full functionality in future releases.
- Adding new Tunnel Clients and Servers to your hosting order is currently available only through CLI. A guide on how to do that is coming soon.
