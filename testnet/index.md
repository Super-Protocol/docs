## What is Super Protocol Testnet?

The Testnet is an operational work-in-progress version of Super Protocol. It is continuously updated with new releases and functionality. 

- The latest release is Testnet 2 and it contains the following major updates:
Decentralized confidential hosting. The users can now host their own static websites on the Super Protocol network. The system of tunnels is used where the Tunnel Client holds the applications and data in a confidential enclave and the Tunnel Server is responsible for public ingress (public static IPâ€™s) that routes to the Client. More tunnels means more stability and resistance to attacks.
- Marketplace UI. The brand new user-friendly UI that is replacing the RocketGirl UI from Testnet 1. This is the user interface that we will be evolving with new functionality and it will carry on to the mainnet.

Of course these are not all the updates. There is a new architecture and many other improvements.

## Known Issues and Limitations

Since this is testnet, there are some limitations on performance:
- The hosted sites will only be live for 72 hours. This is a limit we imposed to ensure consistent performance on testnet.
- There may be short (1-2 minutes) interruptions in service for hosted sites when new orders go live. This will be fixed within couple of weeks after launch.
