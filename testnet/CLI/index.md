## Introduction

Super Protocol CLI is a powerful tool for developers. It supports all functions that are currently available in the protocol.

## Getting started

You can download CLI from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Super-Protocol/ctl). It will be constantly updated in the future so follow the announcements in our social networks.

Before you can use CLI you need to create a configuration file. Please refer to [this guide](/testnet/cli/configuration) to do that.

To get familiar with the available commands please use [commands documentation](/testnet/cli/commands).

If you want to deploy your own solutions on Super Protocol, check [our guides section](/testnet/cli/guides).
