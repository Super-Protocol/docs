## Introduction

Super Protocol Web UI is designed to quickly introduce new users to Super Protocol allowing them to use solutions deployed on the protocol with their own data. No special knowledge is requited to use Web UI.

## Getting started

Before you can use Web UI you need to configure Metamask to work with Matic Testnet Mumbai. Please refer to [this guide](./metamask/) to do that.
