Super Protocol has launched a [Public Testnet](/testnet) and our team is hard at work making it available to more people and extending its functionality. When our community is satisfied with the state of the protocol, the testnet will become the base for our Mainnet launch.

We are planning many interesting events at the Testnet stage. If you are interested in taking part, please [sign up](/testnet) and join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/superprotocol) to keep up to date with the latest developments of the protocol.

You are welcome to read our [Whitepaper](/whitepaper) if you want to know more about Super Protocol.

If you have any further questions or would like to become a partner or otherwise be involved in the development of Super Protocol, please use [a request form on our website](https://superprotocol.com/contact).
