# For Developers

### What is the Super Dev Community?

Super Protocol is a Web3 infrastructure project, and as such it is only as good as the community that will build on it. We are looking for talented and dedicated developers, individuals and teams, to form the core of this community and plant the seed from which it will grow. 

We believe that decentralized confidential computing is the future foundation of Web3 and we are building a whole Web3 cloud service to prove it. We hope that you will believe it too.

### What is the goal here?

To be frank, the goal is to experiment. This is not meant to be a rigid, formal exercise. The Super Protocol solution is ready for third party apps - and we really want to see what you'll come up with!

Specifically for this exercise we have built a proof-of-concept app: [Super Chat](/testnet/chat). It's a complex web app that runs entirely inside of [Trusted Execution Environment](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/software-guard-extensions.html), on multiple machines provided by different cloud providers. Chat data is saved and synchronized via decentralized storage ([Storj](https://www.storj.io/)). Tunnels provide public external IPs, improve load balancing, reduce DDOS attacks and hide inbound traffic from the host machines. It's certainly the first of a kind. 

So, here's the idea: we want to gather a reasonably small group of Web3 developers, put them together in a closed Slack channel, and and see what comes out of it. It has elements of both an incubator and a hackathon: you have the ideas and the skills, and we have the confidential computing resources and technical knowledge of Super Protocol (of course). Let's create something awesome!

We plan to begin this exercise around mid-September 2023 and have something to show by the end of the year.

What do you say?

### What are we building?

It's up to you what to build - but we would prefer it to be Web3 related in some way and run inside a TEE.

Here are some ideas from us:

| Areas | Description |
| ---------- | -- |
| Games | Web3 games: blockchains, smart-contracts, crypto, NFTs and other digital assets, DAO.|
| DeFi | Decentralized finance and GameFi. Example: confidential off-chain computing for DEX.|
| AI | This is a big one. Confidentiality will allow AI to train on sensitive personal data.|
| Oracles | Confidentiality may enable oracles to process sensitive private data from off-chain.|
| DID | Decentralized identity. Confidentiality may be used in identity processing such as KYC. |

Also we are going to build sample mini-applications to be used as reference during development. Here are the technical use cases:

| Use Case | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Dynamic web apps with tunnels | Complex web applications (such as [Super Chat](/testnet/chat/)) that require external public IP (via tunnels).|
| Smart-contracts and oracles | Building Web3 oracles that provide a way for smart-contracts to exchange data with external off-chain sources. |
| Smart-contracts with off-chain computing | Offload the heavy lifting to off-chain computing environments to remove limitations imposed by smart-contracts. |
| Python-based solutions | Such as AI/ML Python scripts for computations on data that do not require internet access. |
| Node.js-based solutions | Various Node.js apps that do not require internet access. |

### Who are the candidates?

We would like you to be:
* Passionate about decentralization and Web3 technologies.
* Curious about confidential computing (you don't have to be an expert).
* Experienced in developing Web3 apps and dApps.
* Enthusiastic about learning and trying new things.
* A team player, willing to share feedback, contribute and be patient about technical issues that inevitably arise during testnet.
* Willing to be the pioneer at the edge of innovations and get the bragging rights!
* Comfortable sharing your knowledge and helping new members of the community who will come after you (optional, but desirable).

### How to apply?

Please fill out this **[application form](https://forms.gle/8VyGcVdtvESfuw1w7)**. 

We anticipate an overwhelming number of requests, so please be patient. This will be a highly selective process. We plan to begin this exercise in mid-September 2023 with the core closed group of developers and then gradually add new members.
