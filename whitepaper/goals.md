# Goals
Effectively, data could be in three states: at rest, in transit and in use. Traditionally, a variety of encryption methods have been used to protect data in storage or during transmission. However, data remained vulnerable during processing. Confidential computing resorts to hardware protection during processing to solve this problem.

Confidential computing is rapidly gaining popularity among today's cloud service providers and consumers of such services in large companies. Google calls this a [breakthrough](https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing) technology, while [Gartner anticipates](https://www.r3.com/gartner-2021-privacy-enhancing-computation/) that by 2025, 50% of large companies will be using confidential computing. However, unlike traditional cloud services, where trust in the provider is a key factor, Super Protocol is a decentralized trustless system, which makes confidential computing an indispensable element at the core of the protocol itself.

Even though the demand for confidential computing, in and of itself, continues to grow, Super Protocol offers the market so much more. It is an open, decentralized platform that features infinite computational resource scalability, supports complete confidentiality at the hardware level, and provides a unique environment for creating an ecosystem of thousands of data sources, algorithms for data processing and unique solutions in the areas of AI, IoT, VR/AR, etc. Furthermore, any developer, be it an individual or a large corporation, will enjoy equal opportunities with respect to making additional contributions to the ecosystem.

According to a [McKinsey study](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/ecosystem-2-point-0-climbing-to-the-next-level), consumers and service providers put an ever larger emphasis on the ecosystems: “Seven in ten consumers we surveyed said they value ecosystem offerings that simplify their purchase journey. Perhaps more surprisingly, 60 percent of US banks we surveyed said they were likely to form or join an ecosystem.” Furthermore, [McKinsey expects](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/how-do-companies-create-value-from-digital-ecosystems) this trend to continue in the coming years: “The integrated network economy could represent a global revenue pool of $60 trillion in 2025 with a potential increase in total economy share from about 1 to 2 percent today to approximately 30 percent by 2025.”

But what if this ecosystem is open and decentralized? As 2020–2021 showed, the demand for such systems is so high that it is not discouraged even by sky-high transaction fees that have reached several hundreds of dollars on the Ethereum platform. A modern ecosystem owned by a large cloud service provider may offer hundreds of services, but it is still a closed ecosystem. Super Protocol, as a Web3 alternative, potentially ensures an unlimited number of combinations of computational capacity, public and private data, and innovative services, all under one open protocol.
## Target Audience
### Computational Resource Owners
The history of humanity's computer hardware has come a long way from the unique computing machines owned or operated by large corporations and universities, to marketplaces where anyone can rent any amount of computational resources for any period of time.

Super Protocol aims to offer owners of computing resources an open, fully decentralized public blockchain-based protocol through which computing power could be provided directly to end users, bypassing intermediaries, while generating a guaranteed, stable stream of income.

Currently, there is a large amount of equipment on the market that is used for all kinds of commercial computing, such as:

1. Classic cloud computing;
1. Cryptocurrency mining;
1. Different kinds of blockchain validation and computing;
1. GPU renting (for example, [Vast.ai](https://vast.ai/)).

Super Protocol is very unique in a way that it allows equipment owners to engage into useful confidential computing of any complexity, generating a steady, predictable income stream.
### Data Owners
Data in the modern world is being created everywhere, while new, more advanced processing algorithms allow for an ever larger number of ways to use this data. However, there are quite a few challenges here. Obviously, large volumes of data are not originally meant to be public, which means it requires anonymization or confidential computing.

High-quality anonymization is not always possible without losing data utility. Additionally, many of today’s analytical tools enable successful [data de-anonymization](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_oak09.pdf) under many different circumstances: “To demonstrate its effectiveness on real-world networks, we show that a third of the users who can be verified to have accounts on both Twitter, a popular microblogging service, and Flickr, an online photo-sharing site, can be re-identified in the anonymous Twitter graph with only a 12% error rate.”

Almost any data owner would benefit from monetizing it—as long as it does not harm their business as a whole. This is borne out by the widespread development of technologies for analyzing big data.

Super Protocol offers data owners a simple, convenient route for monetizing their data—with no intermediaries involved, and while maintaining full data confidentiality.
### Service Developers
Technology tends to become more complex over time, as evidenced in particular by the development of artificial intelligence over the past decade. Consequently, technological solutions require more labor, more in-depth expertise, and more computational capacity. As development costs rise, the need to protect intellectual property becomes paramount. At the same time, any solutions in today's fast-paced world must be constantly updated and provide easy scalability.

It follows from the foregoing that software developers are finding it increasingly difficult to promote their own solutions. This is especially true for small companies and individual developers. A high cost of computing resources, a lack of user-friendly platforms for promoting and selling solutions, and the risk of know-how leakage are serious constraint factors affecting innovation.

Super Protocol solves all those problems by offering developers a direct sales channel to consumers, bypassing intermediaries, as well as providing all the tools necessary to quickly scale the solutions while protecting intellectual property.
### Consumers of Data Analysis and Services
Who owns the information, he owns the world, it was once said. This old adage becomes more and more relevant with each new year. But the problem is that the exponential growth in the volumes and variety of data makes distilling the kernels of value out of it an increasingly difficult task. In addition to data access, one needs technology and methods for processing it the right way.

Successful companies are always on the lookout for new approaches that would enable them to communicate accurately and effectively with their respective target audiences, increasing their sales and making their offerings ever more competitive. In the modern world, this is most often achieved through the efficient use of all available data and information technologies.

Super Protocol offers an open, decentralized ecosystem of computational resources, innovative products and services, data sources (including those previously unavailable for confidentiality reasons), and data processing tools.
