# Goals
Effectively, data could be in three states: at rest, in transit and in use. Traditionally, a variety of encryption methods have been used to protect data in storage or during transmission. However, data remained vulnerable during processing. Confidential computing resorts to hardware protection during processing to solve this problem.

Confidential computing is rapidly gaining popularity among today's cloud service providers and consumers of such services in large companies. Google calls this a [breakthrough](https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing) technology, while [Gartner anticipates](https://www.r3.com/gartner-2021-privacy-enhancing-computation/) that by 2025, 50% of large companies will be using confidential computing. However, unlike traditional cloud services, where trust in the provider is a key factor, Super Protocol is a decentralized trustless system, which makes confidential computing an indispensable element at the core of the protocol itself.

Even though the demand for confidential computing, in and of itself, continues to grow, Super Protocol offers the market so much more. It is an open, decentralized platform that features infinite computational resource scalability, supports complete confidentiality at the hardware level, and provides a unique environment for creating an ecosystem of thousands of data sources, algorithms for data processing and unique solutions in the areas of AI, IoT, VR/AR, etc. Furthermore, any developer, be it an individual or a large corporation, will enjoy equal opportunities with respect to making additional contributions to the ecosystem.

According to a [McKinsey study](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/ecosystem-2-point-0-climbing-to-the-next-level), consumers and service providers put an ever larger emphasis on the ecosystems: “Seven in ten consumers we surveyed said they value ecosystem offerings that simplify their purchase journey. Perhaps more surprisingly, 60 percent of US banks we surveyed said they were likely to form or join an ecosystem.” Furthermore, [McKinsey expects](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/how-do-companies-create-value-from-digital-ecosystems) this trend to continue in the coming years: “The integrated network economy could represent a global revenue pool of $60 trillion in 2025 with a potential increase in total economy share from about 1 to 2 percent today to approximately 30 percent by 2025.”

But what if this ecosystem is open and decentralized? As 2020–2021 showed, the demand for such systems is so high that it is not discouraged even by sky-high transaction fees that have reached several hundreds of dollars on the Ethereum platform. A modern ecosystem owned by a large cloud service provider may offer hundreds of services, but it is still a closed ecosystem. Super Protocol, as a Web3 alternative, potentially ensures an unlimited number of combinations of computational capacity, public and private data, and innovative services, all under one open protocol.
