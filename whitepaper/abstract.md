# Abstract
The launch of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) in 2009 introduced the world to two key technologies that would later form the basis  of [Web3](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/#top) concept:  decentralized digital currency and blockchain with a distributed consensus mechanism. The subsequent development of these technologies—and first and foremost, of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) network, which supported [Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract)—gave rise to a multitude of brand new distributed systems and applications, which attracted millions of users and billions of dollars. Among them, there are such areas as [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance), [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token), and [GameFi](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-gamefi-and-how-does-it-work). Decentralized solutions proved to be highly popular—to the point where the existing capacity appeared to be unable to satisfy the rapidly growing demand. As a result, [transaction costs on the Ethereum network rose to the level of dozens and even hundreds of dollars](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd).

The key Web3 concept is to create open, decentralized alternatives for all the platforms and applications at the core of modern Internet. At the moment there are quite a few ongoing projects that are trying to implement this idea. Little by little, they are filling the gaps that currently exist in the decentralized world.

But decentralization is not the only defining feature of the Web3 concept. It is expected that the following technologies will play a key role in the future: Big Data, AI, IoT, and VR/AR. These technologies require a lot of computational capacity and access to data, know-how and specific tools for creating cutting edge products. The lion’s share of the cloud services market at the moment is [controlled by only three corporations](https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-cloud-market-Q121). The same corporations and a number of other similar entities also control most of the data and technologies that will be fundamental for the Internet of the future.

In addition to massive centralization of computational capacity, [the year 2020 also saw a serious shortage thereof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_global_chip_shortage). This is happening at the time when millions of GPUs are used worldwide [to mine cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) even though they could be deployed to help develop and promote AI solutions in such key areas as healthcare, logistics, education, etc.

On the other hand, exponential growth in the number of data sources, the volume and variety of data, as well as ever more complex algorithms for data processing give rise to more severe requirements for data anonymization and confidential computing. In particular, to meet these requirements, CPU manufacturers have, for a number of years at this point, been honing the [Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment) technology, which allows code to be executed in an isolated environment, protecting data integrity and confidentiality.

Super Protocol uses the latest blockchain and TEE developments to create a universal decentralized protocol for distributed confidential computing. Super Protocol offers an alternative to traditional cloud service providers within the Web3 space and makes it possible for everyone to contribute to the development of innovative technologies for the future Internet.
