## Initial supply breakdown

### Token Generation Event (TGE)

Total supply (fixed): 1 billion

Super Protocol lacks the ability to mint new tokens, which can negatively affect the token's market price in the long term, as there have been many examples in the market.

The structure of the initial token distribution is shown in the graph below.

</p>

In order to minimize the negative impact of token inflation, as well as the possibilities for price manipulation, most of the tokens will be distributed within a 3 year timeframe according to the table below.

|**Category**|**Share**|**Lock-up Period**|**Distribution Schedule**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Public Sale|7.5%|||
|Provider Rewards|10.0%|3 months|Linearly over 33 months after the lock-up period|
|Demand Stimulus|5.0%|3 months|Linearly over 33 months after the lock-up period|
|Staking Rewards|7.5%||Linearly over 36 months|
|Liquidity Rewards|10.0%||2% after the TGE, the rest linearly over 36 months|
|Pre-seed|5.0%|3 months|Linearly on a block-by-block basis over 21 months after the lock-up period|
|Private Rounds|15.0%|3 months|Linearly on a block-by-block basis over 21 months after the lock-up period|
|Team|20.0%|3 months|Linearly on a block-by-block basis over 33 months after the lock-up period|
|DAO|20.0%||1% after the TGE, the rest linearly over 36 months|

### Public token sale

In terms of raising blockchain investments, projects have come a long way from independently conducting public token sales (ICO), then placing the project on centralized exchanges (IEO), all the way to using decentralized exchange platforms (IDO) for these purposes.

A key downside of conducting ICOs, IEOs, and IDOs is the fact that they attract speculative capital to the project: investors are keen to buy tokens at a lower price at the start of the project and exit as quickly as possible once their goals have been met.

[LBP (Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool)](https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-pools-lbps) is a relatively new way of attracting early stage investment that has become increasingly popular recently. It allows the project to attract long-term investors by shaping the market price, hence reducing the possibility of speculation on the price of tokens.

A Super Protocol public sale will be organized on [Copper (copperlaunch.com)](https://copperlaunch.com/). There will be 7.5 per cent of the total token supply (75 million) up for the public sale.

Stablecoins from the public sale will be allocated to the DAO Treasury.

The key goals of conducting a public sale are as follows:

- initial token distribution in the market
- token market price formation
- filling the treasury with stablecoins, which will be used to form liquidity pools on DEXs and for other protocol development objectives

In order to ensure fair pricing and reward early adopters, all unsold tokens during the public sale will enter the secondary token distribution program. Under this program, all buyers who have purchased the token above the closing sales price will be compensated, whilst early buyers of the token will also be rewarded.

### Protocol rewards

Super Protocol has various rewards that will be distributed over a 3 year period to develop the protocol and cover running costs until the project reaches self-sustainability.


|Category|Total Supply|Description|
| :- | :- | :- |
|<p>Provider</p><p>Rewards</p>|10%|Rewards, which are intended to ensure an acceptable level of profitability for the TEE Providers until the project has reached self-sustainability. These rewards are paid in addition to the income from the orders.|
|<p>Demand</p><p>Stimulus</p>|5%|Rewards, which are intended to stimulate demand from consumers of products and services offered on the protocol|
|<p>Staking</p><p>Rewards</p>|7.5%|Rewards, which are intended to ensure an acceptable level of profitability for the stakers until the project has reached self-sustainability.|
|<p>Liquidity</p><p>Rewards</p>|10%|Rewards, which are intended for liquidity providers under liquidity farming programs on key DEXs.|

### DAO (Treasury)

In the early stages, the DAO Treasury Multisig will have access to liquidity. Multisig owners will be able to run small and urgent project support programs. Later, when the project community gains traction, a full-fledged DAO will be created and the management of the treasury will be handed over to it.

The treasury funds will be allocated for the following purposes:

- Protocol expenses
- Grants
- Bounty programs
- Hackathons
- Marketing & PR, and more

### Team and Investors

Super Protocol is a high-tech infrastructural Web3 project that requires significant investment, in-depth market knowledge and unique expertise in cutting-edge technology, as well as a highly professional team with experience from a variety of fields.

The Super Protocol project builds on the experience and knowledge that the founders and team have been accumulating since 2015 in the field of distributed confidential computing and private blockchains. The unique expertise and use of cutting-edge technology has created an innovative platform for sensitive cloud computing that has the potential to become an integral part of the future Web3 infrastructure.

For the first three years, the project will be financed by funds raised through venture capital funding. Thereafter, the costs of the protocol will be covered from its own income when it transitions to a full-fledged DAO.

The venture capital funds that invest in Super Protocol are so-called smart money, which do not invest in the project for super-profits, but are full-fledged partners. This partnership creates synergies by drawing on the unique external experience and expertise gained through participation in a large number of Web3 projects. The funds also provide opportunities for multiplier effects from joint collaborations with projects already in their portfolio. Thus, all Super Protocol participants will be able to benefit from such an investment, which will be reflected in a subsequent increase in the token's price.

Investors who have invested in a pre-seed round will receive 5% of the total token supply. Founders, advisers and project team will be allocated 20% of the tokens. Another 15% of tokens are set aside to raise additional funds during private rounds.

## Token flow and distribution schedule

</p>

TGE will take place on the Ethereum blockchain. The entire token supply of 1 billion tokens will be released as part of the TGE event. The vast majority of tokens will be allocated to smart contracts with a subsequent unlocking within three years.

75 million (7.5%) tokens will be offered for purchase to anyone wishing to buy as part of a public sale on [Copper (copperlaunch.com)](https://copperlaunch.com/). All unsold tokens will be distributed to the public sale participants after the launch of Super Protocol Mainnet on Polygon blockchain.

Once the public sale is complete, a promo staking program on Ethereum will be launched in which anyone will be able to stake their own tokens and get their share of the pool of 10 million tokens (1%) within 6 months.

200 million (20%) tokens are reserved for the future development of the protocol under DAO. Of that, 190 million (19%) will be allocated to the DAO Treasury and will be unlocked linearly over a 3-year period. The remaining 10 million (1%), coupled with the stablecoins from the public sale, will be used to create liquidity pools on major DEXs.

100 million (10%) tokens will be used inside liquidity farming programs on key DEXs and pools. These tokens will go into DAO management and will be unlocked within 3 years.

215 million (21.5%) tokens are intended for distribution as part of various rewards following the launch of Mainnet. Until then, they will be locked in a smart contract. Once unlocked, this amount of tokens will be allocated to the programs as follows:

- Staking for DAO participants: 65 million (6.5%) tokens
- Rewards for TEE Providers: 100 million (10%) tokens
- Stimulating demand for protocol products and services: 50 million (5%) tokens

Investors, founders, advisers and project team will start receiving tokens 3 months after the TGE. A total of 400 million (40%) tokens will be unlocked for them over a period of up to 3 years (2 years for investors).

The distribution of tokens over time since the start of the project is shown in the diagram below.
