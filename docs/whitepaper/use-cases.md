## Confidential computing on demand

Super Protocol is based on confidential computing. Therefore, the basic use case involves renting computing power for a wide range of different tasks. The long-term goal of our protocol development is to create a full analogue of the largest cloud service providers in the Web3 concept.

This scenario includes the following roles:

- User
- TEE provider

### User

Super Protocol is for those who need decentralized, permissionless, trustless and easily scalable computing resources. Computing power can be rented either for a one-time task with a specific result or for an unlimited period of time.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of tasks that can be solved within the scenario:

- Individual developers and companies:
  - Deploying development and testing environments
  - Deploying distributed industrial solutions: from simple services to complex web and mobile applications
- Data Scientists:
  - Preprocessing large datasets
  - Training heavy models
  - Deploying AI services
- Content creators:
  - Rendering photos and videos
  - 3D modeling

### TEE provider

Super Protocol is a good alternative to mining. The versatility of the protocol ensures a relatively even use of all resources: CPU, GPU (in the future), RAM, storage, and network. The same cannot be said about mining, which has repeatedly caused a serious shortage of graphics cards and power supply units on the market, and there have been concerns about [HDD and SSD shortage](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hard-drive-ssd-shortages-imminent-if-new-cryptocurrency-blooms). Also, unlike mining, where multiple resources are used to continuously perform the same type of computation, Super Protocol resources are used to solve user problems, i.e., to constantly create new value.

Resources for the protocol can be provided both by individual owners of hardware that is currently idle and by professional hosts who can use the protocol to better utilize hardware and attract new customers.

## Solutions on demand

On-demand solutions are a logical extension of the previous scenario. In this case, the user takes advantage of the solutions prepared by the protocol providers.

This scenario includes the same roles as the previous one, and adds a new one—Solution Provider.

### Solution Provider

Super Protocol offers solution developers a convenient platform to promote their products and scale with increasing demand for solutions, using as much TEE provider capacity as needed to fulfill orders.

Providers can offer a choice of several solutions according to the table below:

|Solution option|Examples|
| :- | :- |
|One-time use, no computing power included (to be paid separately by the customer)|<p>Solutions where load, data volume, and traffic are unpredictable:</p><p>- AI services: image classification, text translation, article title generation, etc.</p><p>- Services that require high computing power or high traffic volume: e.g., big data processing</p>|
|One-time use, computing power included|<p>Solutions that do not store data, and/or resource requirements are known in advance:</p><p>- Services for processing data from public sources with predictable resource costs: Wikipedia, social media, etc.</p><p>- Services for processing strictly regulated data sets: 10,000 pictures, 100,000 text words, etc.</p>|
|Rent, computing power not included|<p>Solutions where load, volume of data, and traffic are unpredictable:</p><p>- Ready-to-use solutions for business: project management systems, CRM, ERP, etc.</p><p>- AI service for synchronous multiple requests: bots, classification of user comments</p>|
|Rent, computing power included|<p>Solutions that do not store data, and/or resource requirements are known in advance:</p><p>- Services for online processing of data streams: analysis of stock quotes, news</p><p>- Services for visualizing public data: blockchain network statistics</p>|

## Processing of sensitive data

Super Protocol gives owners of sensitive data a unique opportunity to monetize their data without having to build a comprehensive infrastructure for data processing and protection—other providers can offer their own solutions, and Super Protocol will ensure data protection at all stages of its processing.

This scenario includes the same roles as the previous one, and adds a new one—Data Provider.

### Data provider

In the simplest scenario, the data provider may just grant access to the data: processing solutions would come from other providers (the data provider can check and approve them for use), and computing power would be allocated as orders come in.

If maximum control over the data is required, the process can be organized in such a way that the data provider independently verifies all data processing results before handing them over to the customer.

Providers can offer data in several ways according to the table below:

|Solution option|Examples|
| :- | :- |
|One-time use, data only|A data set and a list of pre-tested and approved solutions from other providers for data processing.|
|One-time use, complete solution|A turnkey solution that includes the data set, the data processing solution (in-house or from another provider), and the necessary computing power.|
|Rent, data only|A data source and a list of pre-tested and approved solutions for data processing from other providers. Access to the data source is active as long as the rent is paid.|
|Rent, complete solution|A turnkey solution that includes the data source, the data processing solution (in-house or from another provider), and the necessary computing power. The solution is provided as long as the user pays the rent.|
