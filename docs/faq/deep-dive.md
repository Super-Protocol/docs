# Deep dive in Super Protocol
## What is a Compute Provider?
Compute Provider is an owner of a hardware that they offer as computing power on Super Protocol in exchange for payments and additional rewards. The hardware has to be enabled with confidential computing through TEE.

TEE stands for Trusted Execution Environment technology, which enables confidential computing and helps protect your data and code from any third party access and manipulation, even from the owner of the hardware themselves.

To become a TEE Provider one needs to register on Super Protocol platform and start participating in a consensus mechanism.
## How does the confidential computing process work in Super Protocol?
Confidential computing is enabled by Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) which is a secure area within the main processor that runs isolated environment parallel to the main operating system.

Super Protocol has its own innovation called Trusted Loader Mechanism that allows data and code to be transferred and executed in a completely secure manner. They are only made accessible inside an isolated environment where no one can tamper with them.

A user of the protocol simply places their workloads and processes data in a similar way to using a traditional cloud, however inside Super Protocol everything is completely confidential and secure.
## What is the reason popular Web3 applications are not truly decentralized?
Web3 projects can deploy their core functionality and tokens on the blockchain, but they still need some cloud infrastructure for their websites, user interfaces and APIs. Because of that, they are forced to look at what traditional cloud computing industry has to offer, which is actually incredibly centralized.

It’s not easy to create a decentralized alternative to cloud, because you need confidential computing technologies to create a trustless environment. And those technologies are fairly new and require unique expertise to work with.

Super Protocol team has been working in the confidential computing realm for more than 7 years at this point and has built several enterprise-level solutions that help process large volumes of sensitive data. That’s why this team has whatever is required to build confidential cloud computing platform to fully decentralize Web3 space.
## How does Super Protocol integrate with enterprise solutions?
Super Protocol aims to provide the same user experience as traditional cloud computing services, but in an open decentralized fashion.

The platform is very flexible and is able to potentially support an unlimited number of use cases. Software developers could take advantage of that by becoming a Solution Provider and offering their product and services tailored for different customer needs.

Eventually, Super Protocol will have many ready-to-use solutions and tools for possible integrations with enterprise solutions, traditional products and services and other blockchain-based protocols as well. Customer can either leverage these use cases or build their own.
## How scalable is Super Protocol?
Super Protocol is infinitely scalable because it doesn’t require a lot of redundant calculations as most blockchains do. Each workload on the protocol only consumes the requested amount of computing resources with the required redundancy level.

The platform is built with an idea to connect providers and consumers together, while maintaining high security and enforcing communication rules between the participants. Consumers choose the amount of resource they need and pay for it, while providers render services and receive payments.

Therefore, as long as there is a demand for additional computing power, more providers will offer their resources on the protocol ensuring unlimited scalability.
## What are the far future plans of Super Protocol developing?
Super Protocol will become a go-to decentralize cloud for service providers and consumers and will be easily accessible for any Web3 project and more traditional applications as well.

In order to achieve this, Super Protocol must become a massive ecosystem of cloud services: from hardware and infrastructure all the way to decentralized applications and enterprise-level solutions. There will be a lot of programs focused on brining software developers, data providers to the protocol as well as forming partnerships with other infrastructural Web3 projects.

Super Protocol will become a multichain solution to provide easy-to-use decentralized cloud computing services to numerous Web3 ecosystems and industries.
