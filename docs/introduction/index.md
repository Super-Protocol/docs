Super Protocol has launched public Testnet and our team is hard at work making it available to more people and extending its functionality. When the community is satisfied with the state of the protocol, the testnet will become the base for Mainnet launch.

As part of Testnet Phase 4 we have launched the system of requirements and configurations - a major step towards an operational marketplace economy. Additionally: deploying your own solutions through CLI, off-chain computing capabilities, expanded documentation with detailed deployment examples: Oracles, Minecraft, Super Chat, and more.

If you are interested in becoming a part of Testnet, please [sign up](/testnet) and join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/superprotocol) to keep up to date.

You are welcome to read our [Whitepaper](/whitepaper) and [documentation](/developers) for developers if you want to know more about Super Protocol.
