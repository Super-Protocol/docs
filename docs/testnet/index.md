## What is Super Protocol Testnet?

The Testnet is an operational work-in-progress version of Super Protocol. It is continuously updated with new releases and functionality as the project is making its way towards Mainnet.  

The latest public release is Testnet Phase 4, launched on December 7, 2023. It introduces the following major updates:

- **Slots**. Flexible system of offer requirements and compute configurations such as slots (vCores, RAM, Disk) and options (Bandwidth, Traffic, External Port). This fundamental update is critical for proper resource utilization, pricing, monetization and marketplace economics. Learn more about slots [here](/developers/fundamentals/slots).

- **TEE Quote Verification**. Ability to verify the authenticity of the TEE and the solution offers running inside as well as verify the SSL/TLS certificates to ensure secure tunnels connection. Learn more about quotes [here](/developers/marketplace/confidentiality).

- **Resource Manager**. The resource manager allows for proper load balancing and compute resource allocation.

- **Updated documentation for developers**. Our main audience at this point in testnet are Web3 developers. We want you to use Super Protocol to deploy your solutions and the new documentation includes many specific deployment guides and examples to help you. Get started [here](/developers/).

There are, of course, many more changes and updates under the hood. You may not see them, but they are there.
