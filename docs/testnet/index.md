## What is Super Protocol Testnet?

The Testnet is an operational work-in-progress version of Super Protocol. It is continuously updated with new releases and functionality as the project is making its way towards Mainnet.  

The latest public release is Testnet Phase 3, launched on July 31, 2023. It contains the following major updates:
- **Support for dynamic Node.js applications.** Complex applications on Node.js can now be deployed in Super Protocol.
- **Decentralized confidential Web3 chat.** [Super Chat](/developers/marketplace_offers/chat) is a technological demo developed by the Super Protocol team. By this example we want to show how complex dynamic web apps on Node.js can be run in decentralized confidential environments (TEE).
