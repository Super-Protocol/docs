Testnet is an operational work-in-progress version of Super Protocol. The project uses a continuous delivery approach. The team constantly adds new functionality as Super Protocol moves towards the Mainnet.

The [Marketplace web interface](https://marketplace.superprotocol.com/) is available for everyone to browse. However, you need a Testnet account to access the full functionality like receiving test tokens and creating orders.

- If you are a new user and have never applied, fill out the [**Testnet participation form**](https://superprotocol.typeform.com/testnetm).
- If you have previously applied for the Testnet, you do not need to reapply. Use your existing testnet account.
- If you lost your Testnet invitation email, contact Super Protocol on [Discord](https://discord.gg/superprotocol) or apply again.
- If you have filled out the Testnet participation form, please wait for your turn. The Super Protocol team sends out invites daily, but it may take several days if the number of requests is high. You can ask Community Managers on [Discord](https://discord.gg/superprotocol) about the status of your request. When your access is ready, you will receive a Testnet invitation email with Testnet credentials and detailed instructions.
