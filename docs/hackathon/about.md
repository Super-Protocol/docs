## Hackathon

The [Super Hackathon](https://hackathon.superprotocol.com/) is a global Web3 event designed to demonstrate the scalability and security of Super Protocol’s cloud under real on-chain load. Participants will migrate existing open-source dApps to opBNB, integrate confidential oracle data feeds, and generate verifiable transactions to stress-test performance. The goal is to showcase how real-world decentralized services can operate efficiently, privately, and transparently at scale.

## Super Protocol

[Super Protocol](http://superprotocol.com/) is a confidential Web3 AI cloud, that combines the power of blockchain with confidential computing. Decentralized execution of workloads in [Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)](https://omnida.substack.com/p/trustless-execution-environments) provides developers and enterprises with a secure foundation for running sensitive code and AI workloads without exposing data. The hackathon is the first public demonstration of this infrastructure under competitive, high-load conditions.

## Confidential oracles

Confidential oracles are a key showcase of Super Protocol’s architecture and the advantages of confidential execution. Built on Chainlink Data Feeds and executed inside TEEs, they keep all data and computations private while remaining verifiable on-chain.

Traditional oracles rely on thousands of untrusted nodes to reach consensus, making the whole process quite expensive. Super Protocol achieves the same trust with far fewer nodes, as each operates inside a TEE that cryptographically guarantees honest execution. A single node with 3 CPUs and 4 GB RAM can handle the workload of about 1,000 Chainlink nodes, delivering major improvements in speed and cost efficiency.
