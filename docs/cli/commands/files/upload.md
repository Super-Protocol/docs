Uploads a file to remote storage such as Storj.

The primary purpose of this command is to make the uploading files available for download and execution. This is necessary in two cases:

- With the [`workflows create`](/cli/commands/workflows/create) command, **users** can add the uploaded <a id="solution"><span className="dashed-underline">solution</span></a> or <a id="data"><span className="dashed-underline">data</span></a> to an <a id="order"><span className="dashed-underline">order</span></a> instead of an <a id="offer"><span className="dashed-underline">offer</span></a>. In this case, a short-term storage period is enough.
- Solution and data **providers** can store the contents of their offers to make them available for customers' orders. This requires a long-term storage period.

Depending on the options, the command provides two ways to upload and store the files. Choose one that suits you better:

- **Uploads to storage directly.** This requires a Storj account and SPCTL [configured](/cli/#set-up-storj-access-optional) to use it. The command will upload the file to the root directory of the bucket specified in the SPCTL configuration file.
- **Creates a storage order using a Marketplace storage offer.** This does not require a Storj account but requires paying SPPI tokens for the order according to the offer pricing and selected lease duration.

The input of the command is a TAR.GZ archive file. For solutions, this file is created by the [`solutions prepare`](/cli/commands/solutions/prepare) command. For data, it is an archive containing the dataset files.

The output of the command is a resource JSON file with the information for a compute provider on how to access the uploaded file.

## Syntax

```
./spctl files upload <targzArchivePath>
    [--filename <string>]
    [--output <path>]
    [--skip-encryption]
    [--metadata <path>]
    [--max-concurrent <number>]
    [--storage <offerId,slotId>]
    [--min-rent-minutes <minutes>]
    [--config <path>]
    [--help | -h]
```

## Arguments

| **Name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| `<targzArchivePath>` | Path to the uploading TAR.GZ archive file. |

## Options

| <div style={{width:250}}>**Name**</div> | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| `--filename <string>` | Desired name of the resulting file in storage. The default is a random string. |
| `--output <path>` | Path to save the output resource JSON file. The default is `./resource.json`. |
| `--skip-encryption` | Flag to skip file encryption before uploading. The default is `false`. |
| `--metadata <path>` | Path to a metadata file for adding fields to the resource JSON file. This file is generated by the [`solutions prepare`](/cli/commands/solutions/prepare) command. |
| `--max-concurrent <number>` | Maximum concurrent pieces to upload at once per transfer to limit the number of threads. Use only when dealing with a memory-constrained environment. |
| `--storage <offerId,slotId>` | Option to use a storage offer. State the IDs of the offer and the <a id="requirements"><span className="dashed-underline">requirement slot</span></a>, separated by a comma. |
| `--min-rent-minutes <minutes>` | Storage lease period in minutes. Use this option together with `--storage`. The default is `60`. |
| `--config <path>` | Path to the SPCTL configuration file. The default is `./config.json`. |
| `--help`, `-h` | Help for the command. |

## Examples

### Example 1. Upload to storage directly

```
./spctl files upload content.tar.gz
```

To execute this command successfully, you need a Storj account and SPCTL configured to use it. Refer to the [Set up Storj](/cli#set-up-storj-access-optional) section to create a bucket and access grants and set up SPCTL.

### Example 2. Upload and create a storage order

```
./spctl files upload content.tar.gz --storage 47,49 --min-rent-minutes 120
```

Where:

- `--storage 47,49`: Create a storage order using the [Storj DCS Offer](https://marketplace.superprotocol.com/storage?offer=offerId%3D47&tab=pricing) (offer ID: 47) and the requirement slot with ID 49.
- `--min-rent-minutes 120`: Set the lease period for 120 minutes.

Since the `--storage` option is set, the command does not require a Storj account. However, when the lease period is over, the content will become unavailable unless you [replenish the order deposit](/cli/commands/orders/replenish-deposit).

### Example 3. Upload using additional options

```
./spctl files upload ./data/content.tar.gz \
    --filename data.tar.gz \
    --output ./data-resource.json \
    --metadata ./meta.json \
    --storage 25,33 \
    --min-rent-minutes 120
```
