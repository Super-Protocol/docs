The **Upload File** button opens the [**Upload Content**](/marketplace/my-content/my-files/upload-content) window. Read [How to Upload a Model (TGWUI)](/marketplace/guides/upload-tgwui) and [How to Upload a Model (ComfyUI)](/marketplace/guides/upload-comfyui) for step-by-step instructions.

The table in the middle of the screen includes the following columns:

- **Type**: indicates whether the content is a **Model** or **Dataset**.
- **Name**: the name of the content. It may differ from the original file name.
- **Date Uploaded**: the date and time when the content was uploaded.
- **Size**: file size of the file in gigabytes. For the exact size in bytes, check the file's [**Info**](/marketplace/my-content/my-files/info).
- **Storage**: the storage to where you uploaded the content, either **Super Cloud** or **Storj**. Read about [types of storage](/marketplace/account/web3#storage).
- **Offer ID**: the identification number of the offer created from the uploaded file. No number means an offer has not yet been created.

To add a model or dataset to an order, click the blue **[+]** button next to it.
