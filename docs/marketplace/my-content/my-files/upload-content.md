This window allows you to upload files to Super Protocol. Uploading serves two purposes:

- You can add your uploaded AI models and datasets to orders instead of Marketplace offers.
- Registered providers can create offers to lease the uploaded models and datasets to other users.

Web3 users can [select a storage](/marketplace/account/web3) to upload files to in the Account window:

- Super Protocol's Storj accountâ€”Super Protocol cloud
- Your personal Storj account.

Demo users are limited to the Super Protocol cloud.

Before uploading a model or dataset, pack it into a TAR.GZ archive. For detailed steps, refer to the guide on [How to Upload Content](/marketplace/guides/upload).
