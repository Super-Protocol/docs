## Offers

To add a model or dataset to an order, click the blue **[+]** button next to it.

You can view the list as either tiles or a table. The buttons in the top-right corner allow you to sort offers, switch between views, and customize table columns. The same list in the table view:

<br/>

In the table view, you can see the following columns:

- **ID**: a unique offer identification number. It is incremental and continuous for model offers and dataset offers.
- **Name**: the name of the offer as defined by its provider.
- **Provider**: the name of the provider offering the content.
- **Price, hr**: the hourly rate for leasing the offer.
- **Price, fix**: the fixed price for each use of the offer, regardless of the lease duration.

Clicking an offer opens the [**Offer**](/marketplace/marketplace/offer) window, which provides further details such as descriptions, requirement slots, and pricing.
