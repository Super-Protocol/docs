To add a model or dataset to an order, click the blue **[+]** button next to it or go to the **Pricing** tab in the **Offer** window.

In the table view, you can see the following columns:

- **ID**: a unique offer identification number. It is incremental and continuous for model offers and dataset offers.
- **Name**: the name of the offer as defined by its provider.
- **Provider**: the name of the provider offering the content.
- **Price, hr**: the hourly rate for leasing the offer.
- **Price, fix**: the fixed price for each use of the offer, regardless of the lease duration.

Clicking an offer opens the [**Offer** window](/marketplace/marketplace/offer), which provides further details such as descriptions, requirement slots, and pricing.

In the current version of the Marketplace, you can only filter by the model categoryâ€”the type of task that the model is designed to perform:

- **Text Generation** is a Large Language Model (LLM) capable of processing text prompts written in natural human language and generating text responses. The best-known example is ChatGPT.
- **Text-to-Image** is a model that generates images based on provided text instructions. The best-known examples are MidJourney and Stable Diffusion.
