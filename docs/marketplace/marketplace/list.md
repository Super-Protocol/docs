In the table view, you can see the following columns:

- **ID**: a unique offer identification number. It is incremental and continuous for model offers and dataset offers.
- **Name**: the name of the offer as defined by its provider.
- **Provider**: the name of the provider offering the content.
- **Price, hr**: the hourly rate for leasing the offer.
- **Price, fix**: the fixed price for each use of the offer, regardless of the lease duration.

Clicking an offer opens the [**Offer** window](/marketplace/marketplace/offer), which provides further details such as descriptions, requirement slots, and pricing.

To add a model or dataset to an order, click the blue **[+]** button next to it or go to the **Pricing** tab in the **Offer** window.
