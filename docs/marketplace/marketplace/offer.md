## Metadata

On the right-hand side of the window, you can find metadata about the offer:

- **Offer ID**: a unique identifier; it is incremental and continuous across model and dataset offers.
- **Offer Type**: the type of the offer:
    + **Model**
    + **Dataset**
    + **Engine**
    + **Compute**.
- **Provider**: name of the provider that created the offer.
- **Category**: the tasks the model or dataset is intended for.
- **Published**: date and time when the offer was created.

## About tab

The **About** tab displays the general description of the offer's content given by its provider.

## Pricing tab

The **Pricing** tab contains details about how many confidential computing resources the offer requires.

The offer provider can configure multiple sets of requirements called *[slots](/fundamentals/slots#requirements)*. Each slot may have a different price based on expected usageâ€”higher workload typically imply higher pricing.
