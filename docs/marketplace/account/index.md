## Web3 User account

_Web3 User account_ is the recommended account type in Super Protocol. It provides access to all Marketplace capabilities, including:

- Full decentralization and sole control of user's funds, models, and datasets.
- Ability to upload models and datasets to the Super Protocol cloud or a personal Storj account.
- Placement of orders with Marketplace offers or the user's own uploaded content.
- Registration of individual providers and full control of earned funds and rewards.
- Creation and monetization of model and dataset offers on the Marketplace.
- Ability to request additional test TEE tokens.

Read [How to Log In as a Web3 User](/marketplace/guides/log-in) for detailed instructions.

## Demo User account

_Demo User account_ is a quick way to start with the Marketplace. It streamlines a few steps, but this comes at the expense of full decentralization, such as using OAuth2 authentication for login instead of the decentralized MetaMask.

Demo User accounts come with certain restrictions:

- Uploading files is only possible to the Super Protocol cloud, not personal Storj accounts.
- Offer creation is available only with the centralized Super Protocol provider.

To log in as a Demo user, you need an account on one of the supported platforms:

- Google
- Hugging Face
- GitHub
- Microsoft
