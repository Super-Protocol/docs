## Web3 User account

_Web3 User account_ provides access to all Marketplace capabilities, including:

- Full decentralization and sole control of user's funds, models, and datasets.
- Ability to upload models and datasets to the Super Protocol cloud or a personal Storj account.
- Placement of <a id="order"><span className="dashed-underline">orders</span></a> using Marketplace <a id="offer"><span className="dashed-underline">offers</span></a> or the user's own uploaded content.
- Registration of individual providers.
- Creation and monetization of model and dataset offers on the Marketplace.
- Ability to request additional SPPI tokens.

Read [How to Log In as a Web3 User](/guides/log-in) for step-by-step instructions.

## Web2 User account

_Web2 User account_ is a quick way to start with the Marketplace. It streamlines a few steps, but this comes at the expense of full decentralization, such as using OAuth2 authentication for login instead of the decentralized MetaMask.

To log in as a Web2 user, you need an account on one of the supported platforms:

- Google
- Hugging Face
- GitHub
- Microsoft
