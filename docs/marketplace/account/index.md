Super Protocol offers two types of accounts:

- Web3 account
- Demo account

(image Enter Marketplace window)
<br/>
<br/>

Accounts are generated automatically when you log in for the first time. You do not need to register an account manually.

## Web3 account

A _Web3 account_ is the primary type of account in Super Protocol. It provides the full functionality of the Marketplace, including:

- Uploading files to the Super Protocol cloud or a personal Storj account.
- Building and placing orders.
- Registering providers and creating offers (not implemented yet).

To enter as a Web3 user, you need an ERC-20 wallet and the MetaMask browser extension configured for access to the Polygon Amoy testnet. Read the guide on [How to Log In](/marketplace/guides/log-in#as-a-web3-user) as a Web3 user.

## Demo account

A _Demo account_ offers a quick way to explore Super Protocol. It does not require MetaMask or an ERC-20 wallet; instead, it uses OAuth2 authentication through one of the following providers:

- Google
- Hugging Face
- GitHub
- Microsoft
- Facebook

Every Demo account receives a limited amount of TEE tokens for placing orders but comes with functional restrictions.

### Limitations for Demo Accounts

Compared to Web3 accounts, Demo accounts have the following limitations:

- Cannot upload files to personal Storj accounts and can only use Super Protocol cloud storage.
- Cannot replenish their token balance.
- Cannot register providers and create offers.

Future updates to the Marketplace will introduce new features and, consequently, additional limitations for Demo accounts.
