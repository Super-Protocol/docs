This window provides details about your [Web3 account](/marketplace/account#web3-account).

(image Demo Account window)
<br/>
<br/>

**User ID**: your unique user ID; it is your ERC-20 wallet address.

**Login**: the Web3 login method and the ERC-20 wallet address you are using. Currently, Super Protocol only supports MetaMask.

**Storage**: as a Web3 user, you can select a storage to upload files to. The available options are:

- **Super Protocol cloud**: Super Protocol's Storj account.
- **Your Storj account**: your personal Storj account.

Uploading to the Super Protocol cloud:

- Does not require additional setup
- Requires paying test TEE tokens to keep the uploaded files available (not implemented yet)
- Uses Super Protocol's Storj account and thus relies on Super Protocol as the storage provider.

Uploading to a personal Storj:

- Requires creating and setting up a Storj account
- Gives sole control over the uploaded content.
