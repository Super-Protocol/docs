**User ID**: your unique user ID is your EVM wallet address.

**Login**: the Web3 login method and the EVM wallet address you are using. Currently, Super Protocol only supports MetaMask as a Web3 login method.

**Get SPPI** and **Get BNB** buttons allow you to get tokens necessary to place <a id="order"><span className="dashed-underline">orders</span></a>:

- SPPI tokens are required to pay and receive payments in Super Protocol.
- BNB tokens are required to pay for opBNB blockchain transactions.

## Storage

You have two options of decentralized storage to upload files:

- **Super Protocol cloud**:
    + Recommended for most users.
    + Does not require additional setup.
    + Uses Super Protocol's Storj account and thus relies on Super Protocol as the storage provider.
- **Your Storj account**:
    + Intended for advanced users.
    + Requires creating and setting up a Storj account.
    + Gives sole control over the uploaded content and storage account.
