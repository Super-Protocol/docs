## Storage

Super Protocol supports two options of decentralized storage to upload files:

- **Super Protocol cloud**:
    - Does not require additional setup.
    - Uses Super Protocol's Storj account and thus relies on Super Protocol as the storage provider.
    - Costs SPPI tokens for additional storage beyond the basic free package.
- **Your Storj account**:
    - Available to Web3 users only.
    - Requires creating and setting up a Storj account.
    - Gives sole control over the uploaded content and storage account.

To enable uploading to your personal Storj account, [log in as a Web3 user](/guides/log-in).
