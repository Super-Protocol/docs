The table in the center of the screen provides essential information about your orders:

- **Created Date** (hidden by default): the date and time when the customer placed the order.
- **Modified Date**: the date and time of the latest change in the order status.
- **Order ID**: a unique offer identification number. It is incremental and continuous for all orders and suborders on Super Protocol.
- **Status**: current status of the order. Learn more about [statuses](/fundamentals/orders#order-status).
- **Cost to Date**: the total amount of TEE tokens spent on the order so far.
- **Balance**: the remaining order balance. When it reaches zero, the order gets the Done status. You can replenish the balance using the **Extend Lease** button.
- **Model**: the main model used in the order; only for Deploy and Fine-tune orders.
- **Datasets** (hidden by default): the main dataset used in the order.

Clicking an order opens its [**Order** screen](/marketplace/orders/order) with detailed information.
