### Slots

The offer provider can configure multiple sets of *[requirement slots](/fundamentals/slots#requirements)*. Each slot may have a different price based on expected usageâ€”a higher workload typically implies higher pricing.

Slots may be divided into two categories:

- For GPU: run the model on an NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU.
- For CPU: run the model on an Intel TDX CPU. Note that the model may run slower in this mode. However, it may be a suitable way to deploy smaller models since the TDX-only machines are cheaper and has more availability than TDX+H100 machines.

Super Protocol supports two pricing types:

- **Fixed**: a one-time payment for each <a id="order"><span className="dashed-underline">order</span></a>, regardless of the lease duration.
- **Per Hour**: payment is based on the number of hours the offer is leased.

Each slot includes the following requirements:

- **CPU vCores**: The number of virtual CPU cores; can be fractional.
- **CPU RAM**: RAM in gigabytes (GB).
- **GPU vCores**: The number of virtual GPU cores; can be fractional.
- **GPU RAM**: Video RAM in gigabytes (GB).
- **Disk**: Disk space in gigabytes (GB).
- **Bandwidth**: Data transfer rate in megabits per second (Mbps).
- **Traffic**: Total required data transfer usage in gigabytes (GB).
- **Ext.Port**: Availability of an external port for internet access; either **Yes** or **Any**.
- **Min Time** and **Max Time**: Minimum and maximum lease duration limits, as defined by the provider.

The **slotID**, shown in the bottom-right corner of each slot, is a unique identifier. These IDs are incremental and continuous across all offers.
