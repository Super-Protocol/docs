This page contains the most common issues and ways to fix them. This list is incomprehensive and is constantly updated.

## Endless logging in

If the **Enter Marketplace** button is stuck in the loading state, open the MetaMask browser extension to check for pending requests.

<br/>
<br/>

If MetaMask shows no requests, refresh the page and press the **Enter Marketplace** button again.

Some wallet extensions may interfere with login attempts. If you have other wallet extensions installed, temporarily switch them off and try to log in again.

If the problem persists, restart your browser and unlock MetaMask before trying to enter the Marketplace.

This issue may also occur due to Marketplace maintenance. Wait a few minutes and try again, or contact Super Protocol on [Discord](https://discord.gg/superprotocol) for a quick update.

## Order status: Error

The **Error** status means something went completely wrong, and the model was not deployed.

<br/>
<br/>

Click the **Get Result** button to download the order log file containing technical information about the error. The file may be difficult to read, but you can analyze it using a chatbot like Claude, ChatGPT, or similar.

### Model is too big

If your model is too big to fit into current [Testnet Limitations](/marketplace/limitations), the deployment will fail with an error similar to the following:

```
UserWarning: Current model requires 167773440 bytes of buffer for offloaded layers, which seems does not fit any GPU's remaining memory.
```

Upload a variant of the model with a lower-bit quantization or choose another model. Support for bigger models will be available in the future.

### Remote code

Some models rely on scripts without which they will not run. If you deploy such a model with the default settings, the order will end with an error.

An example of such a modelÂ is [cerebras/btlm-3b-8k-base](https://huggingface.co/cerebras/btlm-3b-8k-base).

To avoid this error, allow executing remote code in the engine settings:

1. In the Order Builder, open the engine settings.

<br/>
<br/>

2. Go to the **Model loader** tab, select your model's loader from the drop-down menu, and tick the **trust-remote-code** checkbox.

<br/>

:::warning

Review the code before deploying the model to avoid executing unsafe or malicious scripts.
