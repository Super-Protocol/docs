[Super Protocol](https://superprotocol.com/) is an AI cloud and Marketplace based on the principles of confidentiality, decentralization, and self-sovereignty. In the Super Protocol cloud, confidential computing technology protects data during execution, while blockchain-based decentralized networks provide orchestration, transparency, and verifiability of all processes.

Super Protocol launched [Marketplace 1.0](https://marketplace.superprotocol.com/) in 2022 with limited capabilities and support for only Intel SGX for confidential computing. Now, the company is developing Marketplace 2.0 with a full range of capabilities, support for TDX and GPU confidential computing, as well as a specific focus on confidential AI fine-tuning and deployments.

Super Protocol is developing the new Marketplace in phases:

- Phase 1: Upload
    + Two types of accounts: Web3 and Demo with OAuth2 login.
    + Uploading your files to a decentralized storage network (Storj).
    + Management of uploaded files.
- Phase 2: Deploy
    + Support for Intel TDX and NVIDIA GPU confidential computing.
    + Deploying models in confidential tunnels on a variety of AI engines and settings.
    + Fine-tuning base models with your data.
- Phase 3: Marketplace
    + Creating and managing providers. 
    + Publishing models and datasets on the Marketplace.
    + Fine-tuning and deploying AI models and datasets from the Marketplace.

There will be more phases, but those three are in the immediate plans.

Right now, Super Protocol has launched Phase 1 in a [closed beta](https://beta.marketplace.superprotocol.com). Any feedback would be very much appreciatedâ€”please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/superprotocol).
