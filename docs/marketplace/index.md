[Super Protocol](https://superprotocol.com/) is an AI cloud and Marketplace based on the principles of confidentiality, decentralization, and self-sovereignty. In the Super Protocol cloud, confidential computing technology protects data during execution, while blockchain-based decentralized networks provide orchestration, transparency, and verifiability of all processes.

Super Protocol launched Marketplace 1.0 in 2022 with limited capabilities, supporting only Intel SGX CPUs. Now, the company is developing Marketplace 2.0 with a full range of capabilities, support for Intel TDX CPU and NVIDIA H100 GPU confidential computing, and a specific focus on confidential AI fine-tuning and deployments.

Super Protocol launched the first public release of [Marketplace 2.0](https://marketplace.superprotocol.com/) on November 27, 2024. It includes the following capabilities:

- Demo account with OAuth2 login for a quick start.
- Support for Intel TDX and NVIDIA GPU confidential computing.
- Ability to upload model files to the Super Cloud or personal Storj accounts.
- AI model deployment in confidential tunnels using various AI engines and settings.
- Redesigned UI/UX.

Upcoming features in the future development phases:

- Publishing offers in the Marketplace from uploaded files. Currently, publishing is limited to selected researchers, testers, and developers.
- Fine-tuning models by creating new layers for base models.
- Support for datasets.
- Expanded model availability in the Marketplace.
- Additional AI engines and support for more model categories.
- A light UI theme.
