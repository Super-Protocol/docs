[Super Protocol](https://superprotocol.com/) is an AI cloud and Marketplace based on the principles of confidentiality, decentralization, and self-sovereignty. In the Super Protocol cloud, confidential computing technology protects data during execution, while blockchain-based decentralized networks provide orchestration, transparency, and verifiability of all processes.

Super Protocol launched Marketplace 1.0 in 2022 with limited capabilities and support for Intel SGX CPU only. Now, the company is developing Marketplace 2.0 with a full range of capabilities, support for Intel TDX CPU and NVIDIA H100 GPU confidential computing, and a specific focus on confidential AI fine-tuning and deployments.

Super Protocol launched the first public release of [Marketplace 2.0](https://marketplace.superprotocol.com/) on November 27, 2024. It has the following capabilities:

* A demo account with AOuth2 login for a quick start.
* Support for Intel TDX and NVIDIA GPU confidential computing.
* Uploading your model files to the Super Cloud or personal StorJ accounts.
* Deploying AI models in confidential tunnels using a variety of AI engines and settings.
* UI/UX redesign.

Features coming up in the next phases:

* Publishing offers in the Marketplace from the uploaded files.
* Fine-tuning mode (train new layers of the base models).
* Support for datasets.
* More models and datasets available in the Marketplace.
* More AI engines available (and more model categories).
* A light UI theme.
