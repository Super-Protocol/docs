The **New Offer** button opens a [modal window](/marketplace/my-offers/new-offer) where you can upload a model and create an offer. After uploading, you can publish the offer on the Marketplace to lease the model to other users or deploy the model without publishing. Check the guides on how to [Deploy Your Model](/marketplace/guides/publish-offer) and [Publish an Offer](/marketplace/guides/publish-offer) for step-by-step instructions.

The table in the center of the screen lists all your offers, both published and unpublished.

The **Edit** button opens the [Offer Builder](/marketplace/my-offers/offer-builder) allowing you to modify and publish an offer to the Marketplace.

The **Deploy** button adds the offer to an order and opens the [Order Builder](/marketplace/order-builder) to quickly deploy the model.
