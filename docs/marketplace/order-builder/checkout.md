This window informs you about the creation of transactions on the blockchain, which is the final step in placing an <a id="order"><span className="dashed-underline">order</span></a>.

Before your order can be processed, you must pay the initial order deposit. [**Order Builder**](/marketplace/order-builder) shows this amount as **Pay Now** before the checkout.

The confirmation process depends on the account type:

- **Web3 users** must confirm transactions in MetaMask. If the MetaMask browser extension do not open automatically, open it manually, select the transaction in the **Activity** tab, and confirm it.
- **Web2 users** do not need to confirm transactions, as they do not pay using decentralized wallets. Instead, payment relies on Super Protocol. The transactions are processed automatically.

Note that **Deploy** orders require confirmation of two transactionsâ€”one to pay for the Tunnels Launcher order and another for the main (Deploy) order. Tunnels Launcher creates a confidential <a id="tunnel"><span className="dashed-underline">tunnel</span></a> necessary to access the running model from the internet.

Once the order is placed successfully, you will be redirected to its [**Order**](/marketplace/all-orders/order) screen.

## Handle errors

If an error occurs during transaction confirmation, you will see the error message in this window and a notification in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
