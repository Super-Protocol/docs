## About the Campaign

The Super Protocol Data-for-AI Campaign is more than a contest—it’s a collaborative initiative to rethink how AI systems are trained in high-stakes, regulated domains. By sourcing high-quality, publicly available regulatory and clinical data, we aim to make AI development transparent, decentralized, and verifiable from the ground up.

This campaign is powered by Super Protocol, a decentralized cloud platform designed for privacy-preserving AI computing. It combines confidential execution, on-chain traceability, and cryptographic proof of origin, creating a secure foundation for open collaboration between AI systems and data contributors.

### Why It Matters

AI companies in regulated industries like healthcare face a difficult trade-off: build costly internal systems to collect and validate data, or rely on opaque, third-party pipelines with unknown provenance. Both come with serious limitations—compliance overhead, audit risks, and a lack of trust in the data itself.

This campaign explores a third path: a verifiable, decentralized pipeline for AI training. Every submitted data link is publicly auditable, cryptographically signed by the contributor, and logged to a smart contract on the opBNB network. It’s not just about finding data—it’s about proving where it came from and how it was used.

We’re working with Tytonix, whose medical AI systems will be trained directly on this dataset. Their tools help medical device companies navigate regulatory approvals faster and at lower cost. Your contributions fuel a real-world application with immediate value.

### Why Verifiability Is Crucial

In healthcare AI, data integrity isn’t optional. It must be provable—both to regulators and the companies relying on it.

Super Protocol ensures every submission has a traceable origin, a clear audit trail, and immutable on-chain attribution. This builds a usable bridge between community-sourced input and production-grade AI.

- Verifiable input → trusted model
- On-chain record → compliance-ready data
- Decentralized sourcing → scalable, cost-effective pipelines

What’s submitted here isn’t just checked off—it’s accounted for.

### Just the Beginning

Super Protocol already supports confidential AI training: models run in secure environments where data remains private, even from developers. Deployments are signed, logged, and verifiable. That infrastructure is live.

What’s missing—until now—is granular, user-attributed input. The ability to train AI on individual contributions, where each data point is trackable, auditable, and tied to its source without sacrificing privacy.

This campaign is the first step. In future phases, contributors will be able to control how their data is used, know when it contributes to training, and opt in or out of specific models. It’s the beginning of a long-term shift: from closed, anonymous datasets to a transparent, accountable, and privacy-respecting AI ecosystem.

### Where You Come In

Contribute real-world data. Climb the leaderboard. Earn your share of $30,000 in USDT and Super Stakes (convertible at TGE).

This isn’t just a data campaign. It’s the foundation for an AI system that doesn’t require trust, because everything is verifiable, transparent, and owned.

## Points and Super Stakes

### Points

Your points are the result of your activity during the campaign and determine your rank on the leaderboard. The more valid data links you submit and the more active your referrals are, the more points you will have.

→ Only the top 1,000 on the Leaderboard will qualify for USDT and Super Stakes rewards.

Your points may come from the following:

| **Action**          | **Points Earned** |
| :- | :- |
| Welcome Bonus       | **300** (one-time) |
| Valid URL           | **100\*** for each valid data link |
| Strike Bonus        | **280** (for exactly 30 valid data links in a day) |
| Referral Submission | **35\*** points for each referral’s valid data link |

**\*** Points issued for a submitted link, directly and through referrals, increase by 4% each day of the campaign.

### Super Stakes

Super Stakes are a separate, long-term reward. The amount of Super Stakes you get depends on your rank on the Leaderboard. At the Token Generation Event (TGE), Super Stakes will be converted into Super Tokens, the native token of the Super Protocol ecosystem.

## Link Submissions

### Submission Rewards

Each time you submit a valid data link—a URL leading to data for AI training—you earn points. The point value increases by 4% each day for all participants, meaning every submission made on a later day is worth more than one submitted earlier in the campaign.

**Point Growth Example:**

Day 1: 100 points per valid link<br/>
Day 2: ~104 points<br/>
Day 3: ~108.2 points<br/>
...<br/>
Day 14 (Final Day): ~168 points per valid link

If you submit exactly 30 valid links in a single day, you will receive a **Strike Bonus** of +280 points.

### Daily Limit

You may submit up to 30 valid data links per day.

The daily submission limit resets at 12:00 PM UTC.

### Accepted Databases

Only links from the following approved sources are eligible:
 
[www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm)

[accessgudid.nlm.nih.gov/advanced-search](https://accessgudid.nlm.nih.gov/advanced-search)

Additional approved sources may be added during the campaign.

### Rejection Criteria

Submissions will be rejected if:

- The link has already been submitted by another participant. Each data link must be unique across the entire campaign.
- The domain is not on the approved list.
- The link is broken or inaccessible.
- The file is not in one of the required formats: PDF, XLSX, XML, or DOCX

### Submission Errors

When you submit links, you may encounter errors. Here is the list:

| **Error** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| This link has been submitted before. | Each link may be successfully submitted only once. |
| Reached the maximum of 30 links per day. | And you should get a Strike Bonus. |
| HTTPS protocol is required. | The URL does not use the HTTPS protocol. |
| The link is not from an approved source. | Links must only use the approved databases. |
| This link is not a valid URL. | Not a valid URL format. |

## Referrals

The referral system allows you to earn additional points by inviting others to join the campaign. The more active your referrals, the more you earn.

### How It Works

- After registration, you’ll receive a unique referral link.
- When someone signs up using your link and starts submitting valid data links, you earn referral points.
- There’s no limit to how many people you can refer.
- Each participant can only be referred once.
- If someone signs up without your link or uses another link first, they cannot be reassigned to you.

### Referral Rewards

You earn points every time your referral submits a valid data link. Referral rewards increase by 4% daily for all participants, just like regular submissions. This means that on later days, every valid link submitted by a referral is worth more than one submitted earlier, regardless of who the referrer is.

**Referral Point Growth Example:**

Day 1: 35 points per valid link<br/>
Day 2: ~36.4 points<br/>
Day 3: ~37.9 points<br/>
...<br/>
Day 14 (Final Day): ~58.8 points per link

The longer the campaign runs, the more valuable each referral’s activity becomes.

Note: While later submissions earn more per link, inviting people early gives them time to contribute more overall, resulting in higher total rewards for you.

### Referral Penalty

If your referee submits an invalid data link, you’ll lose the referral reward for one previously earned link from that referee. This only affects the bonus points earned from that specific referee and does not impact your own points or rewards from other referees.

Referral points cannot go negative, and the same rule applies individually to each referee and each invalid link.

This mechanism is designed to prevent abuse and discourage low-quality or automated submissions.

## Rewards

### Reward Recipients

Only the top 1,000 participants will get prizes, and the rewards will depend on the rank. The rank is determined by the user’s total points: own points plus referral points. 

| **Rank**  | **USDT**    | **Super Stakes** |
| :- | :- | :- |
| 1–3       | $1,000 each | 15,000 each |
| 4–10      | $500 each   | 10,000 each |
| 11–50     | $200 each   | 5,000 each |
| 51–200    | $50 each    | 1,900 each |
| 201–1,000 | $10 each    | 500 each |

Tiebreaker: whoever earned points **earlier** wins the higher rank.

Claiming Rewards

Winners will be announced within three days of the campaign’s end. Rewards can be claimed starting **after June 25** by logging in with the same wallet used during participation. **USDT rewards** will be available through a dedicated campaign page, while **Super Stakes** will convert to Super Tokens at the Token Generation Event (TGE). All rewards will be claimable on the **opBNB network**.

All participants in the top 50 will be required to complete KYC to verify identity and prevent bot activity.

## Disputes and Final Authority

Super Protocol reserves the right to disqualify participants for fraudulent or malicious behavior, require KYC verification before releasing rewards, and modify campaign rules at any time. In case of disputes or interpretation conflicts, all decisions made by Super Protocol are final.
