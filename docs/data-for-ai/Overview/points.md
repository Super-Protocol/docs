Your points are the result of your activity during the campaign and determine your rank on the leaderboard. The more valid data links you submit and the more active your referees are, the more points you will have.

Your points may come from the following:

| **Action**          | **Points Earned** |
| :- | :- |
| Welcome Bonus       | **300** (one-time) |
| Valid URL           | **100\*** for each valid data link |
| Strike Bonus        | **280** (for exactly 30 valid data links in a day) |
| Referral Submission | **35\*** points for each valid data link |

**\*** Points for submitting a link, directly and through the referral program, increase by 4% daily during the campaign.
