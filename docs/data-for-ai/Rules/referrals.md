The referral system allows you to earn additional points by inviting others to join the campaign. The more active your referees, the more you earn.

## How it works

- After registration, you’ll receive a unique referral link.
- When someone signs up using your link—a *referee*—and starts submitting valid data links, you earn referral points.
- There’s no limit to how many people you can refer.
- Each participant can only be referred once.
- If someone signs up without your link or uses another link first, they cannot be reassigned to you.

## Referral rewards

You earn points every time your referee submits a valid data link. Referral rewards increase by 4% daily for all participants, just like regular submissions. This means that on later days, every valid link submitted by a referee is worth more than one submitted earlier, regardless of who the referrer is.

**Referral Point Growth Example:**

Day 1: 35 points per valid link<br/>
Day 2: ~36.4 points<br/>
Day 3: ~37.9 points<br/>
...<br/>
Day 14 (Final Day): ~58.8 points per link

The longer the campaign runs, the more valuable each referee’s activity becomes.

Note: While later submissions earn more per link, inviting people early gives them time to contribute more overall, resulting in higher total rewards for you.

## Referral penalty

If your referee submits an invalid data link, you’ll lose the referral reward for one previously earned link from that referee. This only affects the bonus points earned from that specific referee and does not impact your own points or rewards from other referees.

Referral points cannot go negative, and the same rule applies individually to each referee and each invalid link.

This mechanism is designed to prevent abuse and discourage low-quality or automated submissions.
