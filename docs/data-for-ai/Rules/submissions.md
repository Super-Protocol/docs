## Submission rewards

Each time you submit a valid data link—a URL leading to data for AI training—you earn points. The point value increases by 4% each day for all participants, meaning every submission made on a later day is worth more than one submitted earlier in the campaign.

**Point Growth Example:**

Day 1: 100 points per valid link<br/>
Day 2: ~104 points<br/>
Day 3: ~108.2 points<br/>
...<br/>
Day 14 (Final Day): ~168 points per valid link

You receive points when the submitted links are verified; it may take a few hours.

If you submit exactly 30 valid links in a single day, you will receive a **Strike Bonus** of +280 points.

## Daily limit

To help prevent bot activity, each participant is allowed up to **30** submission attempts per day.

- Duplicate links (already submitted) do not count toward your limit.
- Invalid links (wrong domain, broken files) do count as attempts.

The limit resets daily at 12:00 PM UTC.

## Accepted databases

Only links from the following approved sources are eligible:

[ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search)

[European database of suspected adverse drug reaction reports](https://www.adrreports.eu/en/search.html#)
 
[FDA' 510(k) Premarket Notifications](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm)

[Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID)](https://accessgudid.nlm.nih.gov/advanced-search)

Additional approved sources may be added during the campaign.

## Rejection criteria

Submissions will be rejected if:

- The link has already been submitted by another participant. Each data link must be unique across the entire campaign.
- The domain is not on the approved list.
- The link is broken or inaccessible.
- The file is not in one of the required formats: PDF, XLSX, XML, or DOCX
