## Submission Rewards

Each time you submit a valid data link—a URL leading to data for AI training—you earn points. The point value increases by 4% each day for all participants, meaning every submission made on a later day is worth more than one submitted earlier in the campaign.

**Point Growth Example:**

Day 1: 100 points per valid link<br/>
Day 2: ~104 points<br/>
Day 3: ~108.2 points<br/>
...<br/>
Day 14 (Final Day): ~168 points per valid link

If you submit exactly 30 valid links in a single day, you will receive a **Strike Bonus** of +280 points.

## Daily Limit

You may submit up to 30 valid data links per day.

The daily submission limit resets at 12:00 PM UTC.

## Accepted Databases

Only links from the following approved sources are eligible:
 
[www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm)

[accessgudid.nlm.nih.gov/advanced-search](https://accessgudid.nlm.nih.gov/advanced-search)

Additional approved sources may be added during the campaign.

## Rejection Criteria

Submissions will be rejected if:

- The link has already been submitted by another participant. Each data link must be unique across the entire campaign.
- The domain is not on the approved list.
- The link is broken or inaccessible.
- The file is not in one of the required formats: PDF, XLSX, XML, or DOCX
