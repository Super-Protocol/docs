## Reward Recipients

Only the top 1,000 participants will get prizes, and the rewards will depend on the rank. The rank is determined by the user’s total points: own points plus referral points. 

| **Rank**  | **USDT**    | **Super Stakes** |
| :- | :- | :- |
| 1–3       | $1,000 each | 15,000 each |
| 4–10      | $500 each   | 10,000 each |
| 11–50     | $200 each   | 5,000 each |
| 51–200    | $50 each    | 1,900 each |
| 201–1,000 | $10 each    | 500 each |

Tiebreaker: whoever earned points **earlier** wins the higher rank.

## Claiming Rewards

Winners will be announced within three days of the campaign’s end. Rewards can be claimed starting **after June 25** by logging in with the same wallet used during participation. **USDT rewards** will be available through a dedicated campaign page, while **Super Stakes** will convert to Super Tokens at the Token Generation Event (TGE). All rewards will be claimable on the **opBNB network**.

All participants in the top 50 will be required to complete KYC to verify identity and prevent bot activity.
