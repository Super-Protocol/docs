The [**Marketplace web app**](https://beta.marketplace.superprotocol.com/) provides a graphical user interface to the Super Protocol AI Marketplace.

Super Protocol has no manual account creation. The system creates accounts automatically when users log in for the first time. Two login modes are available:

- **Web3 User**
- **Demo User**.

_Web3 mode_ provides the full functionality of the Super Protocol AI Marketplace. It requires an existing ERC-20 wallet and the MetaMask browser extension set up to access the Polygon Amoy testnet. Read [How to Set Up Web3 Access](/ai-marketplace/enter-marketplace/web3-access).

_Demo mode_ is suitable for a quick introduction to the system but imposes [functionality restrictions](/ai-marketplace/enter-marketplace/demo). Instead of MetaMask and an ERC-20 wallet, access in the demo mode required an existing account on one of the following platforms:

- Google
- Hugging Face
- GitHub
- Microsoft
- Facebook.

:::note

The Marketplace web app does not support mobile devices. Use a desktop or laptop with a screen resolution of at least 1280x720.
