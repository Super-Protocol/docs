Demo users cannot upload files to their personal Storj accounts and are limited to using Super Protocol as a [storage provider](/ai-marketplace/upload-content#select-a-storage-provider). Future releases of this version of the Marketplace will introduce additional functionality for both Web3 and demo modes and, consequently, more limitations for demo users.
