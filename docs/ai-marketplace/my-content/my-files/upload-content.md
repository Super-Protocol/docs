The Upload Content window allows you to upload files to Super Protocol. This serves two purposes:

- You can add your uploaded AI models and datasets to orders instead of Marketplace offers. Read [How to Place an Order](/ai-marketplace/guides/guide-place-order).
- Registered providers can create offers to lease the uploaded models and datasets to other users.

Web3 users can select a storage to upload files to in the [Account window](/ai-marketplace/account/web3):

- Super Protocol's Storj accountâ€”Super Protocol cloud
- Your personal Storj account.

Demo users are limited to the Super Protocol cloud.

Before uploading a model or dataset, pack it into a TAR.GZ archive. Read [How to Upload Content](/ai-marketplace/guides/guide-upload).
