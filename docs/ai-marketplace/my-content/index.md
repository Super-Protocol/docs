You can upload AI models and datasets to Super Protocol. This serves two purposes:

- You can add your uploaded models and datasets to orders instead of Marketplace offers.
- If you register a provider, you can create an offer and lease the uploaded model or dataset to other users.

While uploading a file, the system encrypts it and creates a resource JSON file. This resource file contains the information for confidential computing devices on accessing the uploaded model or dataset to use in compute orders.

The functionality related to orders and offers is not implemented yet in this version of the Marketplace.
