You can browse the AI Marketplace without logging in. However, an account is required to place orders, upload content, and create Marketplace offers. Super Protocol does not support manual account creation; instead, an account is automatically generated when a user logs in for the first time.

Two login options available:

- [**Web3 User**](/ai-marketplace/account/web3). This login mode provides the full functionality of the Super Protocol AI Marketplace. It requires an ERC-20 wallet and the MetaMask browser extension set up to access the Polygon Amoy testnet. Read [How to Log In](/ai-marketplace/guides/guide-log-in#web3-user) as a Web3 user.
- [**Demo User**](/ai-marketplace/account/demo). This login mode is suitable for a quick introduction to the system but imposes [functionality restrictions](/ai-marketplace/account/demo#demo-mode-limitations). Read [How to Log In](/ai-marketplace/guides/guide-log-in#demo-user) as a Demo user.
