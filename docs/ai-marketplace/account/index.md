Accessing Super Protocol is free, however, users need a account to place orders, upload content, and create Marketplace offers. Browsing offers is available without registration.

Super Protocol has no manual account creation. The system creates accounts automatically when users log in for the first time. Two login modes are available:

- [**Web3 User**](/ai-marketplace/account/web3). This mode provides the full functionality of the Super Protocol AI Marketplace. It requires an existing ERC-20 wallet and the MetaMask browser extension set up to access the Polygon Amoy testnet. Read [How to Log In] as a Web3 user.
- [**Demo User**](/ai-marketplace/account/demo). This mode is suitable for a quick introduction to the system but imposes [functionality restrictions]. Read [How to Log In] as a Web3 user.
