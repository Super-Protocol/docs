_Demo User_ account is suitable for a quick introduction to the system but imposes [functionality restrictions](/ai-marketplace/account/demo#demo-mode-limitations). Instead of MetaMask and an ERC-20 wallet, access in the Demo mode required an account on one of the following platforms:

- Google
- Hugging Face
- GitHub
- Microsoft
- Facebook.

## Demo Mode Limitations

Compared to Web3 users, Demo users cannot:

- Upload files to their personal Storj accounts and can only use Super Protocol as a storage provider
- Register providers
- Create offers.

Future releases of the AI Marketplace will introduce additional functionality and, consequently, more limitations for Demo users.

## Demo Account window

This window displays information about your account when you are logged in as a Demo user.
