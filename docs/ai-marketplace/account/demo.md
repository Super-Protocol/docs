_Demo User_ account is suitable for a quick introduction to the system but imposes [functionality restrictions]. Instead of MetaMask and an ERC-20 wallet, access in the demo mode required an existing account on one of the following platforms:

- Google
- Hugging Face
- GitHub
- Microsoft
- Facebook.

## Demo Mode Limitations

Demo mode provides limited functionality compared to Web3 mode. Demo users cannot:

- Upload files to their personal Storj accounts and can only use Super Protocol as a storage provider
- Register providers
- Create offers
...

Future releases of this version of the Marketplace will introduce additional functionality for both Web3 and demo modes and, consequently, more limitations for demo users.
