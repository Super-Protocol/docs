## Image Classification

A machine trained Python model that recognizes and classifies objects in an image.

There are a [1000 classes of objects](https://github.com/Super-Protocol/solutions/blob/main/Image%20Classification/classes.txt) that can be recognized and classified by this model.

INPUT

You can use compatible datasets from the Marketplace and/or upload your own data.

It is possible to use several datasets in the same order (for instance, a dataset from the Marketplace and a dataset of your own).

The image format is JPG or PNG. Before uploading your own data all files must be packaged into a TAR or TAR.GZ (TGZ) archive. 

OUTPUT

The model provides output in a TAR.GZ archive. Inside the archive there is an output.csv file, which contains three columns: dataset and image name, the object class, and the probability that the model got it right. Even if you use several datasets there will still be only one output file.
