An application that enables the hosting of apps in decentralized confidential environments.

**INPUT**

Hosting Launcher supports deployment of static web content and dynamic web apps on Node.js. Its purpose is to streamline the process for Testnet users.

Dynamic web apps:

At the moment the only compatible data offer available is Super Chat Config. This offer will deploy the Super Chat app. Deployment of your own Node.js apps is currently not supported through the Marketplace.

Static web content:

You can deploy the Demo Static Website data offer or upload your own static website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

You can use only one website dataset in one order. One website per order.

Before uploading your own data all files and folders must be packaged into a TAR or TAR.GZ (TGZ) archive. There must be an index.html file at the root of the archive.

**OUTPUT**

The output is the domain URL in the following format: https://abcd-klmn-wxyz.superprotocol.dev. The letters are randomized for each order. Each URL is unique.

To optimize performance in Testnet, the domain will only be available for 72 hours. You are welcome to create new orders at any time.

The Hosting Launcher order will also create four new orders for Tunnels. The tunneling protocol ensures balancing of workloads between instances and resistance to DDOS attacks.
