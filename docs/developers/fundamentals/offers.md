## Understanding Offers

There are four basic components that may be involved in creation of an order:

- *Solutions* – base images, tunnel clients, tunnel server, oracles, Python models - basically, any application.

- *Data* – data is anything that is used by a solution: webpages, configs, datasets, databases, etc.

- *Compute* – confidential computing resources where the solutions and data are executed inside the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

- *Storage* – decentralized storages, such as Storj, where the content, computation results and service files are stored.

An *offer* is a solution, data, compute or storage that is made available on the Marketplace for all users. Offers cost money (TEE tokens) to use, prices set by their respective *providers*. 

Specifically solutions and data may be deployed without them being an offer: you can deploy your own application or a dataset privately without making them available on the Marketplace.
