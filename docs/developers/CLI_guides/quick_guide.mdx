This quick guide will take you step by step through the process of deploying your solutions and data on Super Protocol. This is not a detailed guide, it's purpose is only to introduce you to the logic and sequence of the CLI commands. Use the examples inside each command for guidance.

## Prepare solution

### Step 1. Pack solution

In order to be run correctly inside an Intel SGX confidential enclave (TEE), a solution has to be packed and signed with [Gramine](https://gramineproject.io/) (a.k.a graminized).

Run the [**solutions prepare**](/developers/cli_commands/solutions/prepare) command.

As a result, a `tar.gz` archive will be generated.

### Step 2. Upload solution to storage

Before the solution can be executed in TEE, it needs to be uploaded to a storage, from where the TEE will download it for execution.

Run the [**files upload**](/developers/cli_commands/files/upload) command using the `tar.gz` archive above.

As a result, a resource file will be generated in the `json` format, containing the information for TEE on how to access your uploaded solution.

## Prepare data

### Step 1. Pack data

In order to be with the solution, data has to be packed into a `tar.gz` archive.

You can use the following command to create such an archive:

```
tar -czvf archive_name.tar.gz -C ./archive_data
```
Where:
* `archive_name.tar.gz` - the archive name;
* `./archive_data` - the directory where the data is located.

As a result, a `tar.gz` archive will be generated. Please make sure that no system or hidden files are included into the archive.

### Step 2. Upload data to storage

Before it can be executed with the solution inside the TEE, the data also needs to be uploaded to a storage.

Run the [**files upload**](/developers/cli_commands/files/upload) command using the archive file above.

As a result, a resource file will be generated in the `json` format, containing the information for TEE on how to access your uploaded data.

## Manage orders

### Step 3. Create order

In this shared step an order is created, the solution and data from the storage are downloaded into the TEE and executed.

Run the [**workflows create**](/developers/cli_commands/workflows/create) command. Here you will need the `json` resource files generated during the upload to storage.

As result, you will get an `order ID`.

### Step 4. Receive results

Your order may take some time to process. You can track its progress using the [**orders get**](/developers/cli_commands/orders/get) command.

Once the order moves to the status `Done`, then a result may be retrieved using the [**orders download-result**](/developers/cli_commands/orders/download-result) command. Some solutions, such as tunnel server, may have results available earlier because for them status `Processing` may also mean that they are live and operational.

For steps 3 and 4 it may also be more convenient to use the [**Marketplace GUI**](/developers/marketplace/).
