## Overview

Super Protocol has a powerful CLI tool called **SPCTL** (Super Protocol Control). Through this tool you can create and manage orders, providers, keys, workflows, files on external storages, and more. See the full list of commands [here](/developers/cli_commands/).

## Getting Started with SPCTL

To start working with Super Protocol using CLI you'll need to do this sequence of steps.

1. Get Testnet access [here](/testnet/).

2. Set up storage access using [this guide](/developers/cli_guides/storages).

3. Download SPCTL [here](/developers/CLI_guides/downloading).

4. Generate private encryption key using [this command](/developers/cli_commands/workflows/generate-key).

5. Set up config.json using [this guide](/developers/cli_guides/configuring).

6. Set up Marketplace using [this guide](/developers/marketplace/first-steps/) to get your test TEE tokens (this step applicable only during Testnet).

And you're done. We can recommend at first to follow the [Marketplace Walkthrough](/developers/marketplace/walkthrough/) to get a hang of Super Protocol logic.
