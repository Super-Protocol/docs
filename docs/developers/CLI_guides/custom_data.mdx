This guide will take you step by step through the process of using your custom data in SuperProtocol.

## Step 1. Pack data

In order to be used in the execution process, data should be packed into `tar.gz` archive.
You can use the following command to create such an archive:
```
tar -czvf archive_name.tar.gz -C ./archive_data
```
Where:
* `archive_name.tar.gz` - the resulting archive name;
* `./archive_data` - the directory where data is located.

As a result, `tar.gz` archive will be generated. Please make sure that system or hidden files are not included into the archive.

## Step 2. Upload data to storage

Then the archive should be uploaded to a storage. You need to execute `files upload` command and specify the corresponding path to the archive generated at the previous step.
Please follow the [link](/developers/cli_commands/files/upload) to learn more about the command.

As a result, a resource file will be generated in the format of `json`, it will contain the information about how to access your uploaded data.

## Step 3. Execute order using your own data

Finally, in order to use your own data, you need to execute `workflows create` command and specify the corresponding path to the resource file obtained at the previous step as your data offer.
Please follow the [link](/developers/cli_commands/workflows/create#example-using-own-solution-and-data) to observe the example.
