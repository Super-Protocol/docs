This guide will take you step by step through the process of running your custom solutions in SuperProtocol.


## Step 1. Pack solution

In order to be run correctly inside an Intel SGX enclave, a solution should be packed and signed with Gramine (a.k.a graminized).
To do that, you need to execute `solutions prepare` command and specify the corresponding paths to your solution data.
Please follow the link [link](/developers/cli_commands/solutions/prepare) to learn more about the command.

As a result, two files will be generated:
* `tar.gz` archive;
* `metadata.json` file.

## Step 2. Upload solution to storage

Then the archive should be uploaded to a storage. You need to execute `files upload` command and specify the corresponding paths to the files generated at the previous step.
Please follow the link [link](/developers/cli_commands/files/upload) to learn more about the command.

As a result, a resource file will be generated in the format of `json`, it will contain the information about how to access your uploaded solution.

## Step 3. Execute order using your own solution

Finally, in order to run your own solution, you need to execute `workflows create` command and specify the corresponding path to the resource file obtained at the previous step as your solution offer.
Please follow the link [link](https://docs.superprotocol.com/developers/cli_commands/workflows/create#example-using-own-solution-and-data) to observe the example.
