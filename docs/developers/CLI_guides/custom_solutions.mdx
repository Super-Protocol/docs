This guide will take you step by step through the process of running your custom solutions in SuperProtocol.


## Step 1. Pack solution

In order to be run correctly inside an Intel SGX enclave, a solution has to be packed and signed with [Gramine](https://gramineproject.io/) (a.k.a graminized).

Execute the [solutions prepare](/developers/cli_commands/solutions/prepare) command.

As a result, two files will be generated:
* `tar.gz` archive - the actual content to be executed inside the TEE;
* `metadata.json` file - the metadata required to properly load into the storage.

## Step 2. Upload solution to storage

Before the solution can be executed in TEE, it needs to be uploaded to a storage.

Execute the [files upload](/developers/cli_commands/files/upload) command using the two files above.

As a result, a resource file will be generated in the format of `json`, it will contain the information about how to access your uploaded solution.

## Step 3. Execute order using your own solution

Finally, in order to run your own solution, you need to execute `workflows create` command and specify the corresponding path to the resource file obtained at the previous step as your solution offer.
Please follow the [link](/developers/cli_commands/workflows/create#example-using-own-solution-and-data) to observe the example.
