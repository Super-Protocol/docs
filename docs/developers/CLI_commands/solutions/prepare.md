In order to be run correctly inside an Intel SGX confidential enclave (TEE), a solution has to be packed and signed with [Gramine](https://gramineproject.io/) (a.k.a graminized). The goal of this command is to write a [manifest](https://gramine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manifest-syntax.html) which allows the solution code to be executed in a confidential environment. 

Confidential computing technology isolates sensitive data in a protected CPU enclave during processing. This enclave is called TEE. 



Prepare and pack a solution for deployment and execution in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) in Super Protocol. 


It allows to compute solution hashes, including MrEnclave, 


and create a resulting archive that [can be uploaded](/developers/cli_commands/files/upload) to distributed storage for further usage in the process of executing orders. 


To prepare and pack a solution, you need to specify the path to the solution and the key for signing, the hash of whose public part will be MrSigner.





## Usage

```
./spctl solutions prepare <solutionPath> <solutionKeyPath> --base-image-path <baseImagePath> [OPTIONS]
```

**Input**

* Your solution in a folder, including all dependencies;
* Signing key file, generated by the [solutions generate-key](/developers/cli_commands/solutions/generate-key) command;
* Node.js or Python base image downloaded from our offers using the [offers download-content](/developers/cli_commands/offers/download-content) command. You must use specifically these base images.
  * Python base image: `./spctl download-content 5`
  * Node.js base image: `./spctl download-content 6`

**Output**

* A `tar.gz` archive with your graminized solution and dependencies. Base image is graminized, but not included, to be ordered separately.

## Example

In this simplest form, the command syntax looks like this:

```
./spctl solutions prepare ./my-solution/run ./my-solution/signing-key.pem --base-image-path ./base_image.tar.gz 
```
Where:
* `./my-solution/run` - path to the solution folder;
* `./my-solution/signing-key.pem` - path to the signing key file;
* `--base-image-path ./base_image.tar.gz` - path to the Node.js or Python base image.
