Updates a [requirement slot](/developers/fundamentals/slots#requirements) in an existing offer using the information in a JSON file.

**Important:** This command requires SPCTL with the [provider configuration file](/developers/cli_guides/configure#for-offer-providers).

Use the [`offers get`](/developers/cli_commands/offers/offers/get) command to get the IDs of all slots in an offer. Use the [`offers get-slot`](/developers/cli_commands/offers/slots/get-slot) command to get additional information on a slot.

Refer to [Offer requirements](/developers/cli_guides/providers_offers#offer-requirements) to create the initial offer requirements. Refer to the description of the [`offers add-slot`](/developers/cli_commands/offers/slots/add-slot) command for the JSON file format and object descriptions.
