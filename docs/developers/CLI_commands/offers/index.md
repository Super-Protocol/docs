View Super Protocol offers using CLI commands. But it is easier to view them through the [Marketplace GUI](/developers/marketplace). 

## Remarks 
- `value` offer types mean solution and data, while `tee` offer types mean compute (TEE).
- Commands related to offer management (`create`, `delete`, `update`, `enable`, `disable`) are currently hidden and available only to the Super Protocol team.
