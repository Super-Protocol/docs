Upload a file to a remote storage, such as Storj.

Users can temporarily store their solution and data files to create an order using the [workflows create](/developers/cli_commands/workflows/create) command. Providers can store the content of their solution and data offers to make it available for user's orders long-term.

Depending on the options, the command does one of the following:

- Uploads to a storage directly. This requires a Storj account and SPCTL [configured](/developers/cli_guides/configure#set-up-storj) to use it.

- Creates a storage order using one of the storage offers. This does not require a Storj account but requires paying TEE tokens for the order according to the offer pricing and selected lease duration.

Choose one of these methods that suits you better.

## Synopsis

```
./spctl files upload <localPath> [option ...]
```

**Input:**

- TAR.GZ archive. For solutions, this file is created by the [solutions prepare](/developers/cli_commands/solutions/prepare) command. For data, it is an archive containing the dataset files.

:::note
Upload each archive separately. For example, if you are deploying a solution with two datasets, run the upload command three times using different inputs.
:::

**Output:**

- Resource JSON file containing the information for TEE on how to access the uploaded file.

## Argument

|**Name**| **Description**                |
| :- |:-------------------------------|
|`localPath`| Path to the TAR.GZ archive for uploading |

## Options

| **Name**  | **Description**   |
|:---------------------|:------------------|
| `--filename`         | Name of the resulting file in the storage. Default is a random string   |
| `--output`           | Path to save the output resource JSON file. Default is `./resource.json`                |
| `--skip-encryption`  | Flag to skip file encrypting step before upload   |
| `--metadata`         | Path to a metadata file for adding fields to the resource JSON file. This file is generated by the [solutions prepare](/developers/cli_commands/solutions/prepare) command |
| `--max-concurrent`   | Maximum concurrent pieces to upload at once per transfer to limit the number of threads. Use only when dealing with a memory-constrained environment  |
| `--storage`          | Option to use a storage offer. Must follow the format `<offer_id>,<slot_id>`           |
| `--min-rent-minutes` | Storage lease period. Use together with `--storage`. Default is `60`              |
| `--config`           | Path to a configuration file. Default is `./config.json`            |

## Examples

**Example 1.** Upload to remote storage directly

The following command uploads the `content.tar.gz` file in the SPCTL root directory.

```
./spctl files upload content.tar.gz
```

To execute this command successfully, you need a Storj account and SPCTL configured to use it. Refer to the [Set up Storj](/developers/cli_guides/configure#set-up-storj) section to create a bucket and access grants and set up SPCTL.

**Example 2.** Upload using a storage offer

The following command uploads the `content.tar.gz` in the SPCTL root directory. The command creates a storage order using the [Storj DCS Offer](https://marketplace.superprotocol.com/storage?offer=offerId%3D25&tab=pricing)  (ID 25) and the requirement slot (ID 33). The lease period is 120 minutes.

```
./spctl files upload content.tar.gz --storage 25,33 --min-rent-minutes 120
```

Since the `--storage` option is set, this command does not require a Storj account. However, when the lease period is over, the content will become unavailable unless you [replenish the order deposit](/developers/cli_commands/orders/replenish-deposit).

**Example 3.** Additional options

The following command uploads the `content.tar.gz` file located in the `data` directory in the SPCTL root directory. The name of the uploaded file will be `fileData.tar.gz`. The name of the output resource JSON file will be `fileResource.json`. The `fileMetadata.json` metadata file will be added to the resource file during the upload. The command creates a storage order using the [Storj DCS Offer](https://marketplace.superprotocol.com/storage?offer=offerId%3D25&tab=pricing)  (ID 25) and the requirement slot (ID 33). The lease period is 120 minutes.

```
./spctl files upload ./data/content.tar.gz --filename ./fileData.tar.gz --output ./fileResource.json --metadata ./fileMetadata.json --storage 25,33 --min-rent-minutes 120
```
