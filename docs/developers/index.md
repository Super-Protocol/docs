## Play around with GUI (beginner)

If you are just starting out, we advise you to feel your way around Super Protocol using the Marketplace GUI, which is an interactive educational tool we use for onboarding new users. 

Please follow these steps:

1. Get access to Testnet [here](/testnet/).

2. Follow [this guide](/developers/marketplace/first-steps) to set up your Testnet wallet with Metamask and connect to the Marketplace GUI.

3. Complete the [Marketplace Walkthrough](/developers/marketplace/walkthrough/) to create a sample order using the UI.

This should give you some idea of the Super Protocol logic. 

## Deploy solutions with CLI (advanced)

Now you can dive right into it: 

4. Follow [this guide](/developers/cli_guides/) to set up your storage account and configure SPCTL.

5. Familiarize yourself with the concepts of [tunnels](/developers/fundamentals/tunnels) and [slots](/developers/fundamentals/slots), as well as key [CLI commands](/developers/cli_commands) and [Testnet limitations](/testnet/limitations).

6. Take your pick of [deployment guides](/developers/deployment_guides/) with examples to help you through.

This is, of course, just the tip of the iceberg. Super Protocol is a powerful tool and it's up to you to make it your own.
