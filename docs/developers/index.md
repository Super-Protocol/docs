## Introduction

Welcome to Super Protocol, the confidential Web3 cloud computing and marketplace.

This documentation is for developers who are interested in building applications for decentralized confidential environments. The documentation mostly covers topics related to fundamentals and hands-on tinkering with Super Protocol. Parts related to the Super Protocol technical architecture are covered in the [White Paper](/whitepaper).

This documentation is a work in progress and will be updated on regular basis. Your feedback is highly appreciated.

You can use the steps below to get you started.

## Play around with GUI (beginner)

If you are just starting out, we advise you to feel your way around Super Protocol using the Marketplace GUI. 

Please follow these steps:
1. Get access to Testnet [here](/testnet/).
2. Follow [this guide](/developers/marketplace/first-steps) to set up your Testnet wallet with Metamask and connect to the Marketplace GUI.
3. Complete the [Marketplace Walkthrough](/developers/marketplace/walkthrough/) to create a sample tunnels order.

This should give you some idea of the Super Protocol logic. 

## Deploy solutions with CLI (advanced)

Now you can dive right into it:

4. Follow [this guide](/developers/cli_guides/) to configure SPCTL (our CLI tool).
5. Familiarize yourself with the [fundamentals](/developers/fundamentals) as well as key [CLI commands](/developers/cli_commands) and [Testnet limitations](/testnet/limitations).
6. Take your pick of [deployment guides](/developers/deployment_guides/) with examples to help you through.

This is, of course, just the tip of the iceberg. Super Protocol is a powerful tool and it's up to you to make it your own.
