## Introduction

Welcome to Super Protocol, the confidential cloud and marketplace for Web3 and AI.

This documentation is for developers who are interested in building applications for decentralized confidential environments. The documentation mostly covers topics related to fundamentals and hands-on tinkering with Super Protocol. Parts related to the Super Protocol technical architecture are covered in the [White Paper](/whitepaper).

You can use the steps below as an outline of your learning curve with Super Protocol.

## Create first orders with GUI (beginner)

If you are just starting out, we advise you to feel your way around Super Protocol using the Marketplace GUI. 

Please follow these steps:
1. Get access to Testnet [here](/testnet/).
2. Follow [this guide](/developers/marketplace/first-steps) to set up your Testnet wallet with Metamask and connect to the Marketplace GUI.
3. Complete the [Marketplace Walkthrough](/developers/marketplace/walkthrough/) to create a sample tunnels order.

This should give you some idea of the Super Protocol logic. 

## Deploy solutions with CLI (advanced)

Now you can dive right into it:

4. Follow [this guide](/developers/cli_guides/) to configure SPCTL (our CLI tool) as a user.
5. Familiarize yourself with the [fundamentals](/developers/fundamentals) as well as key [CLI commands](/developers/cli_commands) and [Testnet limitations](/testnet/limitations).
6. Use the [Quick Deployment Guide](/developers/cli_guides/quick_guide) to get you started.
7. Take your pick of [deployment guides](/developers/deployment_guides/) with examples for additional deployment scenarios.

## Create your provider and offers with CLI (advanced)

8. Follow the [Providers and Offers Guide](/developers/cli_guides/providers_offers) to create your first provider and an offer.
9. Follow the [Moderation Guidelines](/developers/marketplace/moderation/) to approve your offer for Marketplace GUI.
10. [Update SPCTL configuration](/developers/cli_guides/configure#for-offer-providers) as a provider to enable management of your provider and offers.
11. Use the [SPCTL commands](/developers/cli_guides/providers_offers#faq) to manage your provider and offers.

This is, of course, just the tip of the iceberg. Super Protocol is a powerful tool and it's up to you to make it your own.
