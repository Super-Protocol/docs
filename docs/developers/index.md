## Introduction

Welcome to Super Protocol, a confidential cloud and marketplace for Web3 and AI.

This documentation is for developers who are interested in building applications for a decentralized confidential environment. The articles mostly cover fundamental topics and practical questions of working with Super Protocol. If you are interested in the Super Protocol technical architecture, you can find it in the [Whitepaper](/whitepaper).

Use the steps below as an outline of your learning curve with Super Protocol.

## Create a first order with GUI (beginner)

If you are just starting out, feel your way around Super Protocol using the Marketplace GUI. 

Follow the steps:
1. [Get access](/testnet/) to the Testnet.
2. [Set up MetaMask](/developers/marketplace/first-steps) and connect to the Marketplace GUI.
3. Complete the Marketplace [Walkthrough](/developers/marketplace/walkthrough/) to create a sample tunnel order to get familiar with the Super Protocol logic.

## Deploy a solution with CLI (advanced)

When you know the basics, try SPCTLâ€”the Super Protocol CLI tool:

1. [Configure SPCTL](/developers/cli_guides/) as a user.
2. Read about the [fundamentals](/developers/fundamentals), [Testnet limitations](/testnet/limitations), and key [CLI commands](/developers/cli_commands).
3. Read the [Quick Deployment Guide](/developers/cli_guides/quick_guide) to learn about deploying your solutions.
4. Choose a [deployment guide](/developers/deployment_guides/) to get an example for additional deployment scenarios.

## Create your provider and offers with CLI (advanced)

1. Follow the [Providers and Offers](/developers/cli_guides/providers_offers) guide to create your provider and a first offer.
2. Follow the [Moderation Guidelines](/developers/marketplace/moderation/) to approve your offer for Marketplace GUI.
3. [Update SPCTL configuration](/developers/cli_guides/configure#for-offer-providers) as a provider to enable management of your provider and offers.
4. Use the [SPCTL commands](/developers/cli_guides/providers_offers#faq) to manage your provider and offers.
