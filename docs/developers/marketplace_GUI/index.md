## Marketplace

Marketplace enables providers to list and monetize their [offers](/developers/offers) through Super Protocol. All offers are recorded on blockchain. Additionally, Solution and Data offers have content stored on decentralized storage networks such as Storj. These storage networks are represented by Storage offers. Compute offers are connected to confidential computing (TEE) machines that process the orders. 

Marketplace can be managed entirely via [CLI](/developers/cli_commands/).

## Marketplace GUI

The purpose of Marketplace GUI is to present a user-friendly web interface to the Marketplace as well as an interactive learning experience for onboarding new users. We see it as a companion tool to CLI, but not a full alternative, as the GUI capabilities are currently limited. 

What you can do with the GUI:

* View details of offers available on blockchain;
* Receive TEE and MATIC tokens (for testnet only);
* Create orders using offers;
* Use your own data for the solution offers;
* Generate encryption keys for orders;
* See list of all your orders;
* See details and statuses of specific orders;
* Replenish order deposits;
* Cancel orders;
* Receive order results;
* Check confidentiality.

To be supported in upcoming releases (but not yet):

* Creating orders with your own solutions;
* Connecting your own storage (current default is the Super Protocol account);
* Deploying your own tunnels (current default is the pre-configured provisioner offer that can easily deploy Super Chat and static webpages, but uses Super Protocol credentials);
* Mobile version.
